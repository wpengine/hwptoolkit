WordPress 6.8 brings a luster and gloss that only a polish release can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 Beta 1 contains over 370 enhancements and 520 bug fixes for the editor, including design improvements, polishing the query loop, and more than <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=6.8&amp;group=component&amp;max=500&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=component&amp;col=version&amp;order=priority\">230 tickets for WordPress 6.8 Core</a>. Here’s a glimpse of what’s coming:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Editor improvements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Easier ways to see your options in Data Views, and you can opt to ignore sticky posts in the Query Loop. Plus you’ll find lots of little improvements in the editor!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Style Book comes to Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Style Book now features a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/68036\">structured layout</a> so you can preview site colors, typography, and block styles more easily. You can use the Style Book in classic themes with editor-styles or a theme.json file and includes clearer labels, and you can find them under <code>Appearance &gt; Design</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Support for Speculation browser API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 introduces native support for speculative loading, leveraging the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API\">Speculation Rules API</a> to improve site performance with near-instant page loads. This feature prefetches or prerenders URLs based on user interactions, such as hovering over links, reducing load times for subsequent pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress 6.8 applies a conservative prefetching strategy, balancing performance gains with resource efficiency. Developers can customize speculative loading behavior using new filters, since the API does not include UI-based controls. The existing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/speculation-rules/\">Speculative Loading feature plugin</a> will adapt to the core implementation, allowing deeper customization.&nbsp; Please test this feature in supported browsers (currently Chrome 108+ and Edge 108+, with more browsers evaluating) and provide feedback on <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/62503\">#62503</a> to help refine its implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Major security boost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 will use bcrypt for password hashing, which <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/02/17/wordpress-6-8-will-use-bcrypt-for-password-hashing/\">significantly hardens WordPress.</a> Other hashing is getting hardened, too, throughout the security apparatus. You won’t have to change anything in your daily workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The features included in this first beta may change before the final release of WordPress 6.8, based on what testers like you find.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get an overview of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-8/\">6.8 release cycle</a> and check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/6-8/\"> 6.8-related posts</a> in the next few weeks for further details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Caveat on testing 6.8 Beta 1 in versions older than 5.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to an update made to the upgrade routine during this release, (see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/59803\">r59803</a>), any upgrade from versions older than 5.1 will fail. Folks are working to resolve this specific issue, so please hold off on reporting on this while testing the Beta 1 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vulnerability bounty doubles during Beta &amp; Release Candidate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community sponsors a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/#enhanced-bounty-rewards-during-beta-and-release-candidate-phases\">monetary reward for reporting new, unreleased security vulnerabilities</a>. This reward doubles during the period between Beta 1 on March 4, 2025 and the final Release Candidate (RC) scheduled for April 15, 2025.  Please follow responsible disclosure practices as detailed in the project’s security practices and policies. You can find those on the <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\">HackerOne page</a> and in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/security/\">security white paper</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Just for you: a Beta 1 haiku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>March winds shift the tide.<br>Hands unite in open source;<br>WordPress moves ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>Props to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/audrasjb/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>audrasjb</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/mamaduka/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>mamaduka</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/michelleames/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>michelleames</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/bph/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>bph</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/jorbin/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>jorbin</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/joemcgill/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>joemcgill</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/krupajnanda/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>krupajnanda</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/desrosj/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>desrosj</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/benjamin_zekavica/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>benjamin_zekavica</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lysyjan87/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lysyjan87</a></em> <em>for reviewing and collaborating on this post!</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"18582\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"Shaping Tomorrow at WordCamp Asia 2025\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/02/shaping-tomorrow-at-wordcamp-asia-2025/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 22 Feb 2025 15:04:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"WordCamp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=18515\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:394:\"Over 1,400 attendees from 71 countries gathered at the Philippine International Convention Center in Manila, and nearly 15,000 more joined online, for WordCamp Asia 2025.

Through interactive workshops covering web basics, design, and development, participants gained practical skills while exploring the power of building online.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The new <strong>Career and Social Corners</strong> enhanced networking, fostered meaningful connections, and created new opportunities for those within the WordPress community. Career Corner was the go-to space for attendees exploring career opportunities, connecting with sponsors, and discovering exciting new roles. Meanwhile, Social Corner offered a relaxed, lounge-style environment where attendees could engage in informal discussions over refreshments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Asia kicked off with an incredible Contributor Day, bringing together almost 800 contributors, many of them new, to collaborate, share knowledge, and give back to WordPress.

WordPress&#8217; maturity and extensibility provide a high starting point for innovation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress&#8217; Block Editor has seen tremendous investment, amassing over 34,000 commits &#8211; more than entire competing CMS projects. New capabilities like Full Site Editing (FSE) give enterprises unprecedented ability to enable no-code site building.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Just as being the first user-friendly publishing tool propelled WordPress&#8217; initial growth, AI presents a similar opportunity. WordPress&#8217; contributor community can build not just AI features, but an exciting multi-agent, LLM-agnostic ecosystem representing an intelligent content operating system.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pure-play headless vendors are working backwards to add no-code editing, while WordPress has long supported robust headless capabilities alongside its mature editor. For complex sites, hybrid architectures leveraging both are the pragmatic path forward.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2025/02/WordPress-in-2025-Report-Noel-Tock.pdf\">Download the full WordPress in 2025 (PDF)</a> report directly to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t miss WP:25, the virtual event.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://humanmade.com/wordpress-in-2025-event/?utm_campaign=41192678-WordPress%20in%202025&amp;utm_source=event&amp;utm_medium=Noel%20sales%20outreach&amp;utm_content=event%20landing%20page\">Save your spot at our free event, WP:25</a>, exploring the future of WordPress and featuring key people working with many of the ideas discussed in the report. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the report&#8217;s author, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/noel_tock/\">Noel Tock</a></strong> — Having built his first website back in 1995, Noel has long been watching the evolution of the CMS space.

This remarkable finding from Omnisend&#8217;s research of over 128,000 email campaigns confirms a universal truth about sign-up pages: Simplicity drives success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just being simple isn’t enough – you need to find the balance between collecting essential user data and reducing &#8220;information friction&#8221;. Each additional field creates potential hesitation, yet too little information limits personalization opportunities. The most effective sign-up pages manage this tension masterfully, gathering just enough details without overwhelming potential users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going to give you 9 sign-up page examples that will help skyrocket conversion rates on your website or platform&#8217;s sign-up page! You’ll see minimalist designs that convert at first glance, strategic integration of social proof, and other proven techniques from companies that have mastered the art of turning visitors into registered users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Sign-Up Pages Convert Visitors into Users</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference between a high-converting sign-up page and one that hemorrhages potential customers often comes down to thoughtful design choices. Successful pages don&#8217;t just look good – they strategically reduce obstacles while maximizing value perception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best sign-up experiences balance several competing factors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>They collect enough information to personalize the user experience without creating excessive friction.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They showcase the product&#8217;s value while keeping focus on completing registration.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They build trust through transparency while maintaining a clean interface.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Every element matters: The number of form fields, button text, color psychology, placement of social proof elements, and even microcopy that addresses potential concerns. A visitor&#8217;s decision to sign up happens in seconds, making these subtle optimizations crucial.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The examples covered in this article span the full spectrum of approaches. Some use extreme minimalism with just an email field and a strong call to action, while others carefully structure multi-step processes that break complex registrations into digestible chunks. Each represents a different solution to the sign-up challenge, optimized for specific business goals and user expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these strategies are also part of trends, like the minimalistic approach. If we think about how pages used to be 10 years ago, the difference is massive. New trends will continue to reshape best practices, and an example of that is the integration of profile verification systems that allow users to authenticate via existing accounts, eliminating repetitive form-filling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Services like <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> enable universal profile management, where users maintain a single identity across multiple platforms. This &#8220;update once, apply everywhere&#8221; approach simplifies sign-up flows while ensuring consistent user experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust-building has also become central to sign-up design. With growing privacy concerns, successful pages now clearly communicate how user data will be used and protected. Transparent privacy controls, simple explanations of data policies, and explicit consent mechanisms help overcome skepticism and build confidence during registration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Design Inspiration from Leading Brands</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this section, we&#8217;re going to dive into sign-up page strategies from several industry leaders that go beyond basic design principles. This section examines different approaches to minimalist design, innovative applications of social proof, and data-driven form optimization techniques that create exceptional UX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s dive in!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Minimalist designs that maximize conversion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. PayPal</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/\">PayPal&#8217;s</a> sign-up approach breaks down what could be an overwhelming verification process into a series of manageable steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is done through a progressive disclosure system – rather than presenting users with a lengthy form containing numerous fields, PayPal segments the process into distinct stages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Choose the type of account.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1648\" height=\"1158\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/paypal-signup-page.png\" alt=\"Creating a new PayPal account: Choosing between personal and business\" class=\"wp-image-3042\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Fill in basic information.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1422\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/paypal-business-account-creation.png\" alt=\"PayPal basic sign-up form\" class=\"wp-image-3043\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Verify your email address.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"943\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/paypal-code-confirmation-screen.png\" alt=\"PayPal code verification page\" class=\"wp-image-3044\" />\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it! You officially have a PayPal account. Of course, in order to actually use the account, people need to give further information about their business, but even that’s broken down into manageable steps, and you also have the option to skip the process for the time being.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1007\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/paypal-second-phase-signup.png\" alt=\"PayPal account activation page\" class=\"wp-image-3045\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This chunking technique achieves two important goals. First, it makes the process feel less daunting by hiding the total complexity up front. Second, it creates a sense of investment – once users complete the first step, they&#8217;re more likely to continue through subsequent stages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See how they continue with the business account setup: First, you only have to click a button and select your business type from a drop-down menu, and only after that do you see the longer form with important information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/paypal-signup-flow.gif?w=660\" alt=\"PayPal signup flow for business account creation\" class=\"wp-image-3047\" />\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Mailchimp&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">MailChimp&#8217;s</a> sign-up flow also uses the power of intelligent progressive disclosure. Their form initially appears simple, requesting only essential information like name, email, and password. But this simplicity hides sophisticated mechanics working behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As users begin creating a password, MailChimp reveals password requirements in real time, eliminating the frustration of form rejections after submission.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mailchimp-signup-form.png?w=660\" alt=\"Mailchimp signup page\" class=\"wp-image-3048\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This interactive guidance helps users succeed without overwhelming them with requirements upfront.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Typeform</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/\">Typeform</a> specializes in creating engaging form experiences and naturally applies its expertise to the sign-up process, embodying the company&#8217;s philosophy: Forms should be conversational and human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can register with email or authenticate through existing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google</a> or <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft</a> accounts, so they can choose their preferred method without dealing with a cluttered interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/typeform-signup-page.png?w=660\" alt=\"Typeform signup page\" class=\"wp-image-3049\" />\n\n\n\n<p>What sets Typeform&#8217;s approach apart is how it uses conversational prompts and subtle animations to guide users through each step. Despite offering multiple sign-up options, the page maintains visual simplicity through thoughtful spacing, typography hierarchy, and focused interaction design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typeform also takes advantage of Gravatar integration to further improve the experience. For users with existing Gravatar profiles, their avatar automatically appears in the interface after registration.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/typeform-gravatar-integration.png?w=660\" alt=\"Typeform Gravatar integration in profile settings\" class=\"wp-image-3050\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This eliminates the need to manually upload profile images and creates an immediate sense of personalization that makes the platform feel familiar right from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. SalesForce</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/eu/\">SalesForce</a> tackles the challenge of gathering user information while maintaining engagement through its multi-step trial registration form and a progress tracking system. Clear indicators show users exactly where they are in the process and how many questions remain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/salesforce-signup-form.png?w=660\" alt=\"SalesForce signup page\" class=\"wp-image-3052\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This transparency helps set appropriate expectations and reduces abandonment by making the remaining effort visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each step collects related information chunks, allowing users to focus on one category at a time rather than facing a wall of fields. This reduces cognitive load while still gathering all necessary data for effective lead qualification.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"646\" height=\"606\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/salesforce-step2.png?w=646\" alt=\"Salesforce signup step 2 of 3\" class=\"wp-image-3053\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Social proof and trust signals that work</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social proof elements transform sign-up pages from simple data collection forms into persuasive marketing tools. When implemented effectively, these trust signals overcome hesitation and provide the final push users need to complete registration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Webflow</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://webflow.com/\">Webflow</a> positions itself as a sophisticated CMS and website-building platform for professionals seeking more control than traditional systems like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a>. Their sign-up page reinforces this premium positioning through strategic social proof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The form displays logos from high-profile clients, including <a href=\"http://monday.com\">Monday.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/international/\">The New York Times</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"346\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/webflow-signup-page.png?w=660\" alt=\"Webflow signup page\" class=\"wp-image-3054\" />\n\n\n\n<p>These recognizable brands create an immediate trust signal, showing potential users that Webflow is used by serious organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their team-focused messaging targets decision-makers directly. Rather than addressing individual users, the copy speaks to teams and organizations, prompting leaders to envision how Webflow might serve their entire department or company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. OptinMonster</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/\">OptInMonster</a>, a conversion rate optimization platform, integrates social proof directly into their sign-up process. As specialists in conversion tactics, they practice what they preach in their own registration flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pricing page includes customer testimonials strategically positioned near decision points. These elements appear directly below pricing information, precisely where potential customers might hesitate.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/optinmonster-payment_signup-page.png?w=660\" alt=\"OptinMonster checkout page with a verified customer review\" class=\"wp-image-3055\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The social proof sits alongside automatically applied discounts, creating a powerful combination. The discount creates a sense of value, while testimonials confirm that value through third-party validation, addressing both cost concerns and the need for reassurance at the critical moment of decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Kit</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The email marketing platform <a href=\"https://kit.com/\">Kit</a> takes a personal approach to social proof. Their sign-up page features rotating full-sized images of actual Kit users, with different creator portraits appearing with each page refresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kit-sign-up-page.png?w=660\" alt=\"Kit sign-up page\" class=\"wp-image-3078\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This visual representation helps potential subscribers see themselves reflected in the current user base, creating immediate identification. The rotating images suggest a large, active community without explicitly stating numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By helping visitors envision themselves as part of this community before they even sign up, Kit creates perceived value that motivates form completion and reduces registration friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Smart form optimization techniques</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. OpenAI</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, the company behind ChatGPT and other groundbreaking AI tools, has a sign-up flow that requires just two essential fields: An email address and a password (that is if users don’t want to login with an existing account). This ultra-minimalist approach removes almost all barriers to entry while still collecting the information needed to create an account.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chatgpt-registration-form.png?w=660\" alt=\"ChatGPT signup page\" class=\"wp-image-3056\" />\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this approach particularly effective is OpenAI&#8217;s Gravatar integration. The system automatically pulls in user avatars through <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/api/avatars/images/\">Gravatar&#8217;s Avatar API</a>, enhancing the profile without requiring manual uploads. This allows OpenAI to maintain a clean, uncluttered registration form while still creating personalized user experiences after login.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/open-ai-gravatar-profile-pic.png?w=660\" alt=\"Integrated Gravatar profile picture on an OpenAI profile\" class=\"wp-image-3057\" />\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Gravatar</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar itself offers perhaps the most efficient sign-up process of all, serving as a universal profile service that streamlines registration across the web. The sign-up flow requires only an email address to create a base profile, with verification handled through that same email.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"455\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/create-your-profile-page-gravatar-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar signup page\" class=\"wp-image-3058\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This stripped-down approach perfectly matches Gravatar&#8217;s purpose as an identity service provider. Users create a single profile that follows them across platforms, eliminating the need for repetitive profile creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system also features intelligent platform detection, automatically identifying if a user has an existing <a href=\"http://wordpress.com\">WordPress.com</a> account and enabling one-click sign-up through that connection. This cross-platform authentication further reduces friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"286\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png?w=660\" alt=\"Prompt to login to Gravatar with an existing WordPress.com account\" class=\"wp-image-3079\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar&#8217;s &#8220;universal email profile&#8221; feature is increasingly adopted by major platforms like <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, and OpenAI to improve the user onboarding process and enable developers to implement simple sign-up experiences with <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/\">Gravatar&#8217;s API</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;update once, sync everywhere&#8221; functionality means users maintain consistent profiles across all integrated platforms with a single update. This dramatically reduces profile management overhead and ensures consistent identity presentation across the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers, the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/\">WordPress REST API integration</a> provides a standardized way to incorporate Gravatar profiles into WordPress-based applications, extending this efficiency benefit to the broader WordPress ecosystem with minimal development effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"452\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/profile-settings-wordpress-com-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a WordPress.com profile settings page with a Gravatar profile picture\" class=\"wp-image-3060\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Elevate your sign-up experience now</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing thoughtful sign-up optimizations transforms first interactions from barriers into conversion tools. The best pages share key traits: minimalist design requesting only essential information, strategic social proof building trust, and careful form optimization maintaining registration momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For teams managing user profiles at scale, email-based identity management through Gravatar offers an elegant solution. This &#8220;profile service provider&#8221; approach creates immediate benefits for both developers and users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When users update their Gravatar profiles, changes automatically sync across all integrated platforms, keeping user data current without additional input. This simplifies onboarding while enhancing personalization through API-driven information exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar integration provides three key advantages:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Universal profile recognition across major platforms.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Automatic synchronization of user information updates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Simplified development with <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/getting-started/\">standardized API integration</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern sign-up processes create user-friendly, branded experiences that set the tone for your entire user relationship.

In this article I&#8217;ll tell you a little about my history with this platform and how it changed everything &#8211; from experimental business ideas &#8211; to a real professional experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-childhood\">My childhood</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been passionate about technology, even as a kid. When we got our first computer at home — one of those classic white models my father bought in many installments — it became the main attraction in the house. And rightfully so: it sat in the living room, where everyone could see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back then, I was already browsing the internet, exploring system settings, customizing Windows XP, and maybe (just maybe) installing a few viruses or unwanted installers here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the limitations, I had a lot of fun creating blogs, managing Facebook communities, and trying out platforms like Blogger, Wix, Squarespace — basically anything free that allowed me to publish something online. I didn’t have much technical knowledge, and even less money to invest. But I already had this strong desire to share my ideas with the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-discovering-wordpress\">Discovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the blogs, I loved creating websites for imaginary businesses that never really existed — and honestly wouldn’t work in any real-world scenario. But the excitement was real. Every time a new idea came up, I would recruit some friends to &#8220;invest&#8221; in it and try to convince them it was just a matter of time before we made a lot of money — like the success stories we saw on TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one of these pitches, I showed a site I had built on Wix to a more experienced friend, and he asked me: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“Why are you using Wix? Have you ever tried WordPress?” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That sparked something in me. I had heard of WordPress before but thought it was too complex. Plus, I was always stopped by the need for paid hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, my curiosity got the best of me. I started researching more seriously and quickly realized WordPress was far more powerful than any tool I had used before. But the cost barrier remained. So I put the idea on hold, waiting for the right time to dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-high-school-searching-for-direction\">High school: searching for direction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>High school felt like a marathon. I didn’t really know where I was going, but I knew I had to keep moving. I didn’t have any career role models, nor pressure to follow a specific path. The only reference points were what I saw on TV or heard from distant relatives — law, engineering… the so-called “safe” careers parents often dream of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without a clear direction, I was always committed. I learned English on my own playing RPGs online and created a Duolingo account back in 2014. I used to take part in school competitions — even math ones — not because I was the best, but because I saw them as a chance to stand out. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>If I didn’t have obvious advantages, I’d create my own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That mindset led me to participate in the Junior Achievement &#8220;Junior Company&#8221; program. Our school was selected to form a student-run fictional business, funded by the local government. That experience was life-changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-junior-company-volunteering-and-a-visit-to-a-startup\">My junior company, volunteering, and a visit to a startup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though I was just in my first year of high school — and technically under the age requirement — I asked to join the program and, more boldly, applied to be the company’s president. I put on a dress shirt, prepared a speech, and was elected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite having no real experience, we ended up doing well. Our project turned a small profit (a few reais per “shareholder,” but still, profit!). That success motivated me to stay involved with Junior Achievement. I started volunteering and joined more programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of those opportunities allowed me to spend a day inside a startup in Belo Horizonte. I had never even set foot in a corporate office before — let alone a startup with a playful office, relaxed people, and even a ball pit!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I brought a notebook and wrote down everything I could. The whole experience left me stunned. Up until then, I thought work environments were dull and gray, with strict rules and judgment over things like shoes and dress codes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-first-job-in-that-same-company\">My first job — in that same company?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days after the visit, encouraged by the staff, I created a LinkedIn profile and started sharing every experience I had, no matter how small. Around that time, they gave me access to a free WordPress course. I loved it. I wasn’t just taking the course — I was exploring on my own and learning as much as I could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I kept in touch with the people I had met, interacted with their posts, and shared my progress. Then, one day, I received a message that changed everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the employees who hosted us at the office reached out: the company was looking for someone like me to join the team. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I had recorded a few videos after the visit expressing how much the experience meant to me — and somehow, that had reached them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I was still finishing high school at the time, just 17 years old, when I got the offer. The following year, I started working there as an assistant and began my Computer Science degree on a scholarship.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-promotion-to-developer\">Promotion to developer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In my first two years, I worked mostly with SEO and content distribution, handling a variety of CMS platforms. But WordPress had my heart from day one. Its flexibility, the power to customize everything, and the massive community — it was everything I loved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, an opportunity opened for an internal role as a web developer — and I jumped at it. I went through the selection process and got the position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team was partly based in Brazil, led by our manager Manny, who was in Canada. It was the perfect challenge: a chance to leave my comfort zone and practice English daily. Manny even learned a few Portuguese words with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>As a developer, I dove deep into WordPress.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Each project pushed my limits and made me grow. It was around this time that I also got involved with the WordPress community in my city.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-wordpress-changed-my-reality\">How WordPress changed my reality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress turned out to be so much more than just a tool — it changed my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the income I earned through projects using the platform, I was able to make a down payment on my first apartment. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>That same kid who couldn’t afford hosting fees was now buying property.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And it didn’t stop there. In 2022, I received a job offer from a company in the United States — something I would’ve never dreamed of just a few years earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same year, I attended my first WordPress meetup (still during the pandemic), and later, my first WordCamp as a participant — held remotely in São Paulo. It felt like everything was starting to connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as if all that wasn’t enough, I married the love of my life. It was a simple ceremony, but one we had always dreamed of — made possible, in large part, thanks to the income I earned working with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-returning-to-the-community\">Returning to the Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, we resumed in-person WordPress community meetups after the pandemic. I was nervous — what if no one showed up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they did. We had 25 people, all engaged and eager to contribute, learn, and share. That meetup was a turning point for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I realized I could lead, organize, and give back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I’m actively involved in the community — helping plan events, staying connected with members, and always looking for new ways to contribute. WordPress didn’t just help me build a career — it helped shape who I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-importance-of-english\">The Importance of English</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/journey-resilience/\">Like Rafael shared in another HeroPress story</a>, English remains a big challenge for many of us in Brazil — but also a powerful key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m far from fluent, but I keep learning. Each Duolingo lesson, each YouTube tutorial, each Slack conversation with my international team is a step forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>What matters is not giving up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this entire journey, it’s that everything can change. Sometimes, all we need is a small opportunity, a bit of encouragement — or simply, a platform like WordPress.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id7856_47d34c-b3 alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column7856_92e2da-1b\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<h2 id=\"work-environment\" class=\"kt-adv-heading7856_420812-bc wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Caio&#8217;s Work Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked Caio for a view into his development life and this is what he sent!</p>\n\n\n	<div class=\"hotspots-image-container\">\n		<img width=\"2016\" height=\"1512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/my-desk-1.webp\" alt=\"Caio\'s Desktop\" class=\"hotspots-image skip-lazy\" />\n	</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"kt-adv-heading7856_686471-4d wp-block-kadence-advancedheading has-theme-palette-9-background-color has-background\">HeroPress would like to thank <a href=\"https://wpdrawattention.com/\">Draw Attention</a> for their donation of the plugin to make this interactive image!</p>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"portuguese\" class=\"kt-adv-heading7856_6bd26d-2d wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Como o WordPress Mudou a Minha Realidade &#8211; Gratidão</h1>\n\n\n\nAqui está o Caio lendo sua própria história em voz alta.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Oi! Eu me chamo Caio Ferreira e venho utilizando o WordPress desde 2020. Hoje quero compartilhar um pouco da minha trajetória com essa plataforma e como ela transformou tudo na minha vida – desde ideias de negócios experimentais até uma carreira profissional de verdade.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Na minha infância</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sempre gostei muito de tecnologia desde pequeno. Ainda novo, quando recebemos o nosso primeiro computador em casa, tudo ainda era muito novo. Era um daqueles modelos brancos, que meu pai comprou dividido em muitas vezes, e que virou a atração da casa — também não era pra menos: ele ficava na sala de estar, onde todo mundo via.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naquele tempo, eu já navegava na internet, procurava formas de fuçar o sistema, personalizava o Windows XP do jeito que podia, e talvez (só talvez mesmo) tenha instalado alguns vírus ou instaladores indesejados algumas vezes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apesar das limitações, eu me divertia criando blogs, gerenciando comunidades no Facebook e testando plataformas como Blogger, Wix, Squarespace, ou qualquer outra gratuita que me deixasse publicar algo online. Eu não tinha muito conhecimento técnico, e menos ainda dinheiro para investir. Mas já naquela época eu tinha essa vontade de compartilhar ideias com o mundo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conhecendo o WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Além dos blogs, eu também gostava de criar sites para negócios fictícios, que nunca saíam do papel — e que, honestamente, provavelmente não dariam certo de qualquer jeito. Mas a empolgação era grande. Sempre que surgia uma ideia, eu chamava amigos para “investir” comigo, e tentava convencê-los de que era só uma questão de tempo até aquilo dar certo. Era como víamos nas reportagens de sucesso na televisão.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Em uma dessas aventuras, mostrei o site para um amigo mais experiente, que me perguntou por que eu estava usando o Wix. Ele comentou que existiam outras opções com mais possibilidades, como o WordPress. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Eu já tinha ouvido falar do WordPress, mas achava complexo demais — e, além disso, sempre esbarrava na questão da hospedagem paga.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mesmo assim, aquilo me deixou curioso. Comecei a pesquisar mais a fundo, entendi que o WordPress era muito mais robusto do que qualquer ferramenta que eu tinha usado até então, mas acabei deixando de lado naquele momento. Afinal, eu não tinha como pagar uma hospedagem. Guardei a ideia comigo, esperando por um momento em que ela fizesse mais sentido.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meu ensino médio</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>O ensino médio foi uma maratona. Eu não sabia ao certo onde queria chegar, mas tinha pressa em encontrar esse “algum lugar”. Não tive exemplos próximos de carreira, nem cobrança direta para seguir determinada profissão. As referências eram as mesmas de muita gente: Direito? Engenharia? Os “cursos de sucesso” que a TV e alguns parentes diziam valer a pena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mesmo sem um caminho definido, sempre fui esforçado. Aprendi inglês sozinho jogando RPG online e criei minha conta no Duolingo ainda em 2014. Me destacava em atividades que a maioria evitava — como concursos de matemática — mesmo sem ser o melhor. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>A ideia era simples: se eu não tinha vantagens competitivas óbvias, eu criaria as minhas. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Me envolver nessas atividades era a forma que eu via para construir algo diferente, já que o mercado de trabalho viria logo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foi com esse espírito que participei do programa Miniempresa da ONG Junior Achievement, onde minha escola foi selecionada para criar uma empresa estudantil fictícia, com tudo financiado pelo governo. Aquilo mudou tudo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minha miniempresa, voluntariado e a primeira visita a uma startup</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mesmo sendo do primeiro ano, pedi para participar do programa — mesmo sem ter a idade sugerida — e mais: me candidatei para presidente. Usei uma camisa social e um discurso bem montado, e fui escolhido para liderar a miniempresa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apesar da falta de experiência, conseguimos um resultado positivo. A empresa gerou lucro (poucos reais para cada “acionista”, mas ainda assim, lucro). O programa me deixou animado, e comecei a me envolver em outras atividades da Junior Achievement, atuando como voluntário em eventos e ajudando em novos programas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foi em uma dessas iniciativas que surgiu a oportunidade de visitar, por um dia, uma startup em Belo Horizonte. Eu nunca tinha imaginado sequer entrar na sede de uma empresa, quem dirá de uma startup com escritório descolado, pessoas à vontade, piscina de bolinha e um clima completamente diferente do que eu imaginava ser “trabalhar”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Levei um caderninho e anotei tudo o que pude. Saí de lá em estado de choque, pensando: “é possível trabalhar num lugar assim?”. Até então, tudo que eu imaginava era o oposto: ambientes cinzentos, baías sem graça e muita formalidade.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meu primeiro trabalho — e na mesma empresa?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Poucos dias depois, incentivado pela visita, criei meu LinkedIn (com ajuda de quem nos recebeu na empresa) e comecei a registrar todas as experiências que já tinha vivido. Também recebi acesso a um curso de WordPress oferecido por eles. Gostei tanto da ferramenta que, além do curso, comecei a explorar muito por conta própria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me mantive em contato com o pessoal da empresa, interagia nas redes, compartilhava o que estava aprendendo — até que uma mensagem mudou tudo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uma das pessoas que nos recebeu durante a visita me chamou no privado: a empresa estava procurando alguém com o meu perfil para integrar o time.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Eu tinha gravado vídeos contando o quanto aquela experiência tinha me impactado, e isso, de alguma forma, chegou até eles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Eu ainda estava finalizando o ensino médio, com 17 anos, quando recebi a proposta. No ano seguinte, comecei a trabalhar na empresa como assistente e iniciei minha graduação em Ciência da Computação, com uma bolsa de estudos.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Minha promoção a desenvolvedor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Durante os dois primeiros anos, trabalhei com SEO e distribuição de conteúdo, lidando com diversos CMSs. Mas foi o WordPress que capturou minha atenção desde o começo. A versatilidade, a comunidade, a possibilidade de personalização — tudo me encantava.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quando surgiu uma vaga internacional dentro da própria empresa para atuar como desenvolvedor web, me inscrevi sem pensar duas vezes. Passei por um processo interno, fui aprovado e comecei a atuar em projetos mais técnicos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nosso time era parcialmente brasileiro e liderado pelo Manny, nosso gerente no Canadá. Foi um baita desafio — e uma excelente oportunidade para praticar inglês no dia a dia. Ele, inclusive, chegou a aprender algumas palavras em português com a gente.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>No novo cargo, mergulhei ainda mais fundo no desenvolvimento com WordPress. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Era ali que eu percebia: cada novo desafio me tirava da zona de conforto, mas me deixava mais preparado.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Como o WordPress transformou minha realidade</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>O WordPress foi muito mais do que uma ferramenta de trabalho. Ele transformou minha realidade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Com o que ganhei trabalhando com a plataforma, consegui dar entrada no meu apartamento. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Isso mesmo — aquele mesmo garoto que não podia pagar uma hospedagem agora realizava um sonho pessoal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>E não parou por aí. Em 2022, recebi uma proposta de trabalho de uma empresa dos Estados Unidos. Algo que, anos antes, eu não ousava nem imaginar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naquele mesmo ano, participei do meu primeiro meetup (ainda durante a pandemia), e também do meu primeiro WordCamp como participante — que aconteceu remotamente, em São Paulo. A sensação era de que tudo estava se encaixando.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>E como se não bastasse, me casei com o amor da minha vida. Foi uma cerimônia simples, mas do jeito que sempre sonhamos — e que só foi possível, em grande parte, graças à renda que conquistei trabalhando com WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Retorno à comunidade</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Em 2025, com o fim do período pandêmico, retomamos os encontros presenciais da comunidade WordPress da minha cidade. A ansiedade era inevitável: e se ninguém aparecesse?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mas apareceram. Foram 25 pessoas — todas engajadas, com vontade de aprender, ensinar, trocar experiências. Aquilo foi um divisor de águas pra mim. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Eu entendi que podia liderar, contribuir, devolver um pouco do que recebi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoje, mantenho contato constante com membros da comunidade, ajudo na organização de encontros e eventos, e continuo buscando espaços e oportunidades para fortalecer esse ecossistema. O WordPress não só me ajudou a construir uma carreira — ele ajudou a moldar quem eu sou.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A importância do inglês</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Assim como o Rafael contou em <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/journey-resilience/#portuguese\">outro texto aqui no HeroPress</a>, o inglês ainda é uma barreira para muitos brasileiros. Mas também é uma chave. Uma chave que, quando girada, abre portas para oportunidades inimagináveis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eu não sou fluente. Mas sigo aprendendo. Cada lição no Duolingo, cada vídeo no YouTube, cada conversa improvisada no Slack internacional da empresa é uma forma de evoluir. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>O importante é seguir — mesmo aos poucos, com tropeços.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Porque se tem uma coisa que aprendi nessa jornada toda, é que tudo pode mudar. Às vezes, tudo o que a gente precisa é de um empurrãozinho, uma oportunidade, ou simplesmente&#8230; uma plataforma como o WordPress.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-wordpress-changed-my-life-gratitude/\">How WordPress Changed My Life — Gratitude &#8211; Como o WordPress Mudou a Minha Realidade &#8211; Gratidão</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:54:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Caio Ferreira\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: 164 – Milana Cap on the Interactivity and HTML APIs, and Their Enormous Potential\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=194643\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/164-milana-cap-on-the-interactivity-and-html-apis-and-their-enormous-potential\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44216:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox Podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how the Interactivity and HTML APIs are transforming the way developers work with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Milana Cap. Milana is a seasoned WordPress engineer from Serbia working with XWP, and freelancing through Toptal. She&#8217;s not just a developer, she&#8217;s also active in WordPress community roles such as a co-rep for the documentation team, organizer at multiple WordCamps, and a member of the plugin review team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed some groundbreaking WordPress features that developers should be aware of, specifically focusing on her presentation at WordCamp Asia in Manila, titled, WordPress gems for developers: Fresh new features you&#8217;ll actually want to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start the discussion with the Interactivity API. Milana explains how this feature allows blocks within WordPress to communicate seamlessly with one another. Until now, most blocks were just silos of information, they could not communicate with one another. This API enables developers to manage interactivity across multiple blocks without resorting to custom solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milana also gets into the HTML API, which underpins the Interactivity API. This empowers developers to manipulate HTML attributes using PHP, thereby reducing the reliance on JavaScript. This not only enhances page load speeds, but also simplifies the code management process. It&#8217;s not something that I&#8217;d heard of, but Milana explains how important it can be in rewriting the DOM for whatever goals you have in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the episode, Milana shares examples of these APIs in action, demonstrating how they can simplify and optimize WordPress development projects, particularly at an enterprise level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer looking to leverage these new WordPress features, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, without further delay, I bring you Milana Cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Milana Cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yes. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. I&#8217;ve had to practice that name several times. It&#8217;s lovely to have you on the podcast today. I&#8217;ve never spoken to Milana before, although I&#8217;ve seen her from afar many times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re facing each other because we&#8217;re in the Philippines. We&#8217;re in Manila. It&#8217;s WordCamp Asia, and Milana is doing a presentation at the event. It is called WordPress gems for developers: fresh new features you&#8217;ll actually want to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into that conversation Milana, will you just spend a moment introducing yourself. Tell us who you are, where you&#8217;re from, what you do with WordPress, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> I&#8217;m Milana Cap from Serbia, and we have the best community in the world. I am currently WordPress Engineer at XWP and also freelancing through Toptal. I am one of the co reps for the documentation team, one of plugin review team members. I&#8217;m also a classical musician and just, you know, being loud all around. I like traveling and speaking at conferences, and that&#8217;s basically it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can you just tell us a little bit about the bits and pieces going on in Serbia there? You sound quite proud of it. You said it the best or something like that. You&#8217;ve got a vibrant, healthy growing Serbian community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:49] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s not really growing, and it&#8217;s not that vibrant as it was. But the core of community that started getting together in 2016, or even before that, we still stayed, and we are still active and they&#8217;re like my brothers. We travel, we plan together. We visit each other in Serbia as friends, and we plan for barbecues and all the other stuff, besides, you know, organising events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it really is an actual community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:24] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yeah it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You spend social time together. Oh, that&#8217;s lovely. Yeah, and you mentioned you work with, for, XWP. This is a name that I hear a lot, but I don&#8217;t really know much about the company. Just tell us a little bit about what you do for them, and with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:39] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> First of all, they are sponsoring my time at wordpress.org. It&#8217;s an agency that works mainly with enterprise clients. So we do all of it, like building you a new website, or maintaining the existing one, or fixing problems. And it&#8217;s usually, mostly, just enterprise clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is that an Australian based company?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:02] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of, yeah, based. It&#8217;s created there but we are completely remote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Everything distributed, like a global team. Oh, that&#8217;s nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so let&#8217;s just move on into the topic today. The presentation that you were giving, I&#8217;ll just repeat the title, WordPress gems for developers, fresh new features you&#8217;ll actually want to use. And then I&#8217;ll read the blurb as well because it&#8217;ll give the listeners some context. We&#8217;ll take a closer look at the innovative HTML and Interactivity APIs as the most significant game changers in today&#8217;s WordPress development, with a splash of WP-CLI magic for fast and more fun development. And there might be a surprise or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, obviously on the audio podcast, we&#8217;re not going to be able to breakout WPCLI, but nevertheless, we&#8217;re going to talk about those things. We&#8217;re going to concentrate primarily on the Interactivity API. Obviously this is something that you&#8217;d need to get your hands on, you&#8217;d need to be opening a laptop. But we can&#8217;t do that. It&#8217;s an audio podcast. So first of all, let&#8217;s just break into the topic by asking the question, what is the Interactivity API? And let&#8217;s do that from a total novice perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:07] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Okay, yeah. Well, Interactivity API allows you to get back to the whole page. At least I see it that way. Because before Gutenberg, we were using only PHP, and PHP page is aware of all of its parts. So in header, you know what&#8217;s happening in footer and vice versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then we got Gutenberg and these blocks didn&#8217;t know about their surroundings. They were just like, oh, I&#8217;m a block here, and I do what I do and I don&#8217;t care about others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was difficult to get that in your head, like this is a completely separate entity that, once it&#8217;s in a page, you can work with that, but there is no way to connect to it to the rest of the page. And today you have a lot of requests for having interactive page. You know, not just showing the text and people come and read, you need to have something that&#8217;s happening on that page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was very difficult to, for example, make one block do something and then you use that data in another block, that was insane. And people were trying to do those things in so many different ways. It was a mess. Like, I have a slide with dolls that have misplaced eyes and all of that. That&#8217;s how it looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now with Interactivity API we finally get that connection, but it&#8217;s not like hacky thing, it&#8217;s in Core. So every block can be aware of the other block, and you can send the data from one block to all other blocks. And that&#8217;s really what was missing for a long time. And not just in WordPress, we have the same things happening before WordPress, in Symphony, in Laravel. So now we have that too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So let me just try and sum up what you&#8217;ve just said, and see if I&#8217;ve parsed it correctly and understood it. So prior to Gutenberg, given the PHP nature of WordPress, the bits and pieces that were displaying on the page, so header, footer content and what have you, they had some recognition within PHP of what one was doing and what the other was doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then along comes Gutenberg and we shatter the experience on the page into a variety of different blocks. There&#8217;s an image here, and a paragraph here, and some more text over here, and a heading and what have you. And each of those little blocks is a silo. It lives by itself, for itself, it&#8217;s erected walls around itself so that it can&#8217;t be communicated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:41] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> It&#8217;s a diva.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It can&#8217;t talk out and it can&#8217;t hear things in. And that&#8217;s a problem. I mean, it&#8217;s a brilliant solution if you want to move content around, but If you want one thing to shout to another thing and say, look, I just got clicked, go and update yourself. Add one to yourself, or whatever it may be. So that possibility evaporated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now with the Interactivity API, we&#8217;ve come up with a Core solution. So it ships with WordPress, everybody has it. And suddenly we&#8217;re able to say, okay, I&#8217;m a block, I&#8217;m a button, and when I get clicked, I want you to add one to the cart. And the shopping cart number can increment by one and what have you. So suddenly everything can communicate with everything else. Have I got that about right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:23] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, perfect. Okay. And so I&#8217;ve seen examples of Interactivity over many years since Gutenberg came around, and I&#8217;m imagining that each developer, therefore has had to create their own way of doing it. And presumably that works for them, but it doesn&#8217;t work for the project as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:44] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Not just that. It might work for them but, let&#8217;s say you have a plugin and your plugin is doing that interactive thing with your own blocks. But me as another developer, I want maybe to enhance your blocks, but I don&#8217;t have access to whatever is happening in your blocks. So whatever you are doing, like counting stuff and changing something, I don&#8217;t have that info. So I have to do, again, hacky thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with Interactivity API, I have a standardised access to that. So I can, you know, set my blocks to support Interactivity API. And I can get, with just one function, I can get all the data from your blocks and work with them, and it&#8217;s completely in Core. It&#8217;s standardised. And anybody can take my data and, you know, this data and do whatever they want with that. And it&#8217;s not just that it&#8217;s easy to get that data, but we all do it the same way. So when I open your block, I know exactly what I will find there. I know exactly how to get that data, and how to provide to others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the benefit is basically that it&#8217;s a standard mechanism. Everybody knows what the rules of the game are. So in the past, the experiences that I&#8217;ve seen online where plugin A has been able to clearly demonstrate this interactivity, a different developer coming to that would have to learn how plugin A does it, and then if they go and try and do the same thing for a different plugin from a rival, for example, they would have to learn that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And every time you wanted to do it, you&#8217;d have to learn how that system does it. So there&#8217;s no interoperability. It&#8217;s just little silos of interactivity. They worked, but they were a sort of stepping stone to what we&#8217;ve got now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, I think I understand that. That&#8217;s great. Hopefully the audience has got that as well. That should be good. Can you give us some nice examples that you&#8217;ve seen where the Interactivity API, you describe it, the audience can hear it and readily understand, okay, that&#8217;s something that it can handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:49] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Well, there is a beautiful demo that is used for demonstrating the Interactivity API by people who created Interactivity API. It&#8217;s a movie demo, and you can find it if you go for introductory post of Interactivity API at Core blog, you will find it. So it&#8217;s a simplified Netflix made with WordPress. So you get simple things like there is a favorites. So you can heart a movie, and it&#8217;ll show the number, how many favorites you have. But when you dig deeper, you can open one movie and play the trailer, and it&#8217;ll have a minimised video on the bottom. And you can, you know, browse the website and switch pages, and the video is still playing in the corner and it doesn&#8217;t even hiccup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing that is happening there is you think you are reloading pages. You think you are going to different pages, but it&#8217;s really the same page and it&#8217;s just being reloaded in what you need to reload. So it&#8217;s the hardest thing for developer to do, to switch page, but doesn&#8217;t really reload the page. And if you take a look, if you try that demo and you take a look, you will see that URL changes, everything changes, but you really didn&#8217;t move from the first page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so what you&#8217;ve just described then, you&#8217;ve got a, like a tiled selection of videos, and underneath it is like a little heart icon. So it&#8217;s just a demonstration that if you click the heart icon, it says, I like this one. And then it keeps a record of that somewhere else. Like, how many of you hearted over here? Or, click this heart icon and it&#8217;ll take you to the ones that you favorited. That kind of thing. But also it gives the impression that you&#8217;re reloading pages, but really it&#8217;s all just happening within that one page session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:46] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So that&#8217;s a really easy to understand version of it. And I would imagine something like, let&#8217;s say a shopping cart, I think I mentioned that earlier, where you, I don&#8217;t know, you click that you want to add something to the cart, sort of similar process. It&#8217;s a bit like hearting, isn&#8217;t it? You add something to the cart and you get that interactive cart icon in the top right of the screen if you&#8217;re on a desktop. And it says you&#8217;ve got three items in there, and you click it and you&#8217;ve got four items in there, and so on. Those kind of things. So again, it&#8217;s one part of the website, one block if you like, updating another thing. Are there any other examples that you think are quite useful?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:21] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Well, I saw like countdown. So if you want your website to show the countdown until launching something. There&#8217;s also we have already two examples in Core working. So you have a query block, and you can select to have it paginated, without pagination. That&#8217;s Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anywhere you would use Ajax before, you can use Interactivity API. It&#8217;ll give you that feeling of nothing has been reloaded, so it&#8217;s just loading in that place. You don&#8217;t use Ajax, you just use Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So this would be, I don&#8217;t know, a list of posts or something like that. And at the bottom of the screen, we&#8217;ve seen the first 12, 12 more, you would typically click two or the right arrow or something, and that would do some sort of Ajaxy request. But in this case, that&#8217;s now been removed and we&#8217;re using the Interactivity API, and it will give you the next 12, and the next 12, and so on. Yeah, that&#8217;s a really great example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So presumably, if this is moving into WordPress Core, does that mean that a lot of the Core features that, like for example, pagination, has that now moved over in WordPress Core to using the Interactivity API?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:37] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Well, I know that that specific feature has moved to Interactivity API, and also the image block has the option for lightbox. That&#8217;s also Interactivity API. That&#8217;s currently in Core. And I imagine a lot of other things can be moved. But also it doesn&#8217;t have to. The only thing that it needs is a good documentation, and option that you can use it so you can do with it whatever you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What is the documentation like? You know, if I was a developer and I wanted to begin using this because, sounds good, I&#8217;d rather not maintain my own bucket load of code for my interactivity in my plugin, for example. Let&#8217;s just throw all that out and go with what WordPress has. Is there a ton of documentation to get developers started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:25] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> There is. They are not making the same mistake we had with Gutenberg. I think for Interactivity API, the most difficult thing is to actually understand it. Because we had, I had, as PHP developer primarily, I had a problem to understand Gutenberg and to understand how React works, and why React doesn&#8217;t understand how I think, you know? And I was always over-engineering it because I was covering all the cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But React doesn&#8217;t care about all the cases. It was very difficult for me to understand how that works on components based, and these components don&#8217;t care about anything else but themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Interactivity API now connects all of this. And we are coming back to the system that is aware of all its parts. But not just that, in Interactivity API you have the option to write the code where it makes the most sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was playing with it, I had two blocks that were supposed to talk to each other, and I realised that something that was one block doing, it made the most sense to write the code for it in another block&#8217;s VueJS. So I was using the, there is the template that you can use for Interactivity API, and it&#8217;ll run the Create Block Script, but just use the Interactivity API template. And then you get the block that has switch from light to dark theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a toggle. The first was, it was only the toggle, and I was very disappointed. Like, the toggle shouldn&#8217;t use any JavaScript at all. But it was a good example for what Interactivity API can do. And now with the theme switching, it&#8217;s kind of complete. You understand all the things that Interactivity API is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this toggle was another button, and you click on it, and it shows the paragraph. And then you click on it again and it closes the paragraph. And then I used another block, and I wanted that other block to count how many times I opened and closed this toggle. It was mind blowing that that code for counting how many times I open and close it, I will show the data in this other block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it made much more sense to write the code for it in this first block, because I already have there code that is aware that this is open and closed. So I could just, you know, add one line of the code, and update the number there in another block. So that&#8217;s kind of the most difficult thing with Interactivity API, to understand how that functions, and that you can really achieve a lot with one piece of code, one line of code, but put it in a right place. And it can be in different places. So that&#8217;s something, you know, for you as a developer to document where I wrote things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with the Interactivity API, the most important thing is to actually understand how that works. There is very good documentation there for the basic stuff, definitions and all of it. And also, examples. But really, it&#8217;s not just copy, pasting from example, it&#8217;s playing with it and understanding how it is connected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And once it&#8217;s clicked in your mind, it&#8217;s mind blowing. It&#8217;s like a game. Well, the coding for me is like a game. That&#8217;s why I started coding. But it is very interesting that you can, you know, play with it, you can break it, you can find different ways. And I was playing with putting the same code in different places to see if it will work, it will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is a new skill that we will see with Interactivity API, like the most beautiful code and the most beautiful place where you put that code. And I think it&#8217;s very much open for optimising code. And you&#8217;ll see there the level of expertise of developer for how much they understand the optimisation of JavaScript code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is the Interactivity API, how to describe it, is it finished?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:49] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I mean, basically nothing in WordPress really is ever quite finished, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:54] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> If you software, then it&#8217;s never finished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No. But would you say it already has pretty much everything that you require it to have? Or can you imagine scenarios where it would be really nice to have this feature or this feature? What I&#8217;m trying to get to is, is it still under active development? Can people listening to this podcast who think that that would be an interesting use of their time to help contribute to that, is there still work to be done? And where would we go to get involved in that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:21] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> You can go to, there is a GitHub issue that is called Interactivity API showcase. It&#8217;s in Gutenberg repository. And you&#8217;ll see a lot of different ideas, how people want to use Interactivity API. And you will, when you start looking at those examples, you start to get ideas, what you could use it for. And you get to remember all the projects you had that you could really use Interactivity API there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s done. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll ever be done because, you know, clients get very creative with things they want. And I think we can&#8217;t even imagine what we would want until we get to the request to do it for a project. So there&#8217;s a lot of things to do, as in feature terms, but there&#8217;s always, you know, fixing code, optimising here and there and cleaning things up. And then there&#8217;s an update from library that it depends on, and then you have to, you know, do that. So there&#8217;s always maintenance if you use software. It&#8217;s never done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I feel like if you are, let&#8217;s say 18 years old, you&#8217;ve been brought up in an era where you&#8217;ve had a phone in your hand and the apps on the phone are kind of what you&#8217;ve grown up with expecting from things online. And everything over on the phone is interactive. There&#8217;s just this expectation that you can click a button and it will do some desired action over there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it feels like a website that doesn&#8217;t have interactivity is almost, well, I mean, I know you can have brochure websites and things like that where it&#8217;s just static content. It feels like that&#8217;s the expectation and it&#8217;s more and more going to be the expectation. So if a project like this hadn&#8217;t come along, WordPress websites would&#8217;ve felt really strange. You know, stuck in the past in a way, because of that lack of interactivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now hopefully developers who haven&#8217;t got the time, the budget or the experience to do this on their own, hopefully they can start offering solutions by just reading the documentation and not having to dig into the weeds of absolutely everything, just implement what&#8217;s been written for you, and hopefully that&#8217;ll bring WordPress more into the year 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:36] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Well, I think that if you take from that perspective, like you are 18 years old and have everything, all the apps you want in your phone, I think that WordPress is already weird to them. They are not using CMS, it&#8217;s too much effort for the things they can do with another app in their phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t think that WordPress is for them. I mean, WordPress is CMS. So it&#8217;s meant to be used with purpose while kids today still look for, you know, quick content that they can, my daughter is 21 years old and she sends me, you know, memes and videos all the time. Most often than not, yeah, I tell her I don&#8217;t understand this. And she says, well, it&#8217;s funny because it&#8217;s stupid. I say, I still don&#8217;t understand this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, she understands the life cycle of something that is meaningful, something that is important. And that is something that we would use WordPress for. But their concentration and focus span is just, give me this stupid video, that&#8217;s funny because it&#8217;s stupid, and I&#8217;ll move on. So I don&#8217;t think we should even try to put WordPress there and try to satisfy that request. But still there are requests that Interactivity API does satisfy. And that was needed to be added to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s certainly nice for developers not to have to, well just basically roll their own solution and waste tons of time doing something 1,000 times, literally 1,000, maybe 10,000 times done differently. Whereas now everybody can just lean into this one implementation, and it&#8217;s baked into Core. And then everybody can inject things into, on top of your code, and you can look at other people&#8217;s code and extend it in that way. So hopefully that will mean that, you know, the project as a whole can move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s move on to something that I literally know nothing about, HTML API. You&#8217;re going to have to go from the very most basic description and I will try to keep up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:46] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Well, HTML API is actually what powers Interactivity API. So we wouldn&#8217;t have Interactivity API as it is right now, if we didn&#8217;t have HTML API. For now we have two classes that we can use, HTML tag processor. Which is idea to use PHP to modify attributes in Gutenberg blocks, in their markup. Because it was so difficult to approach the block to get to that code and modify anything once it&#8217;s on the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the HTML tag processor is just working with the attributes in markup. But it was meant to be used for Gutenberg blocks, but it really doesn&#8217;t matter what you use, it&#8217;ll process any HTML if it finds it. And it&#8217;s very useful for many things that we would use jQuery for before, and we would load the whole JavaScript file. You can add, remove, classes. You can set the aspect ratio for iframe. You can set image size attributes. You can add accessibility attributes where you need them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s all happening in PHP, you know, on the page load. It&#8217;s very fast. It&#8217;s amazing. And that&#8217;s what is powering those HTML directives that we have in Interactivity API. So in markup you will find data WP and then the rest of directive. And those directives are connecting the server side and the client side in JavaScript for Interactivity API. I think it&#8217;s called WP Directive Manager, the class that is really internal class, and it&#8217;s just being used by Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then there&#8217;s a class that&#8217;s called HTML processor. And this one is doing more things than tag processor. This one knows about the closing tag, and this one will support inserting and removing nodes from the page, or wrapping and unwrapping tags on the page, then reading and modifying inner content. So everything that you were loading JavaScript for, you know, all the makeup stuff, and if something is clicked then, you know, wrap me this paragraph in this div, and then we will change the class or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do that with PHP now, and it feels so much less hacky. You have it. I had actually example for removing the no-follow attribute for internal links. So searching for internal links, before HTML tag processor, you would have to use regex, and regex is invented by extraterrestrials to make fun of humans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s also, you cannot cover all the cases with regex. There are always surprises. There is always some edge case you didn&#8217;t think of and cover. And when you look at that code, even five minutes later, you don&#8217;t understand anything. It&#8217;s something that you Google, and you trust the code that you found on Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this one, when you used a tag processor, you actually understand everything. And it covers all edge cases. There are no surprises because it&#8217;s been built with HTML standards. So it supports every type of HTML that we will probably never see in our lives. You know, all the broken stuff and all of it, it supports it. And it&#8217;s been built by Dennis Snell. That is something unlike Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we saw that Laravel has it, and Symphony has it, and Phoenix first did it. But this is something that nobody has. This is our own. And Dennis now built it from zero, completely custom. And he&#8217;s now working in putting it into PHP. So it&#8217;ll be available, yeah, to everyone. That&#8217;s a really big thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I gave this talk in September at PHP Serbia and people were sitting, you know, PHP developers who are working with Symphony and Laravel and doing custom PHP, and they were like, oh my God. And I was like, yeah, WordPress has something you don&#8217;t have. That was really nice feeling. Yeah, I like that Dennis is actually putting that into PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So again, like I did with the Interactivity API, I&#8217;m going to do the same here. Let me just see if I&#8217;ve understood what it is. So the idea really, if you want to interact with the DOM, right now, the typical way of doing that is with some JavaScript or other. So let&#8217;s say for example, I don&#8217;t know, you want to do the third child of a div, and you want to put a border around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With JavaScript, you&#8217;re going to find that third div, and then you&#8217;re going to insert some class, which will then get modified by the CSS to add a border and a border radius, and what have you. So that&#8217;s all done on the client side. Page loads, JavaScript loads, and then the DOM gets rewritten by the JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in this scenario, it&#8217;s going server side. It is PHP. So it&#8217;s really much more readable and maintainable, and it all just lives in this one spot with all the other PHP. And then you would write something, basically the same thing, but in PHP, to do the same job. And then WordPress, so there&#8217;s no rewriting of the DOM. WordPress writes the DOM with that in mind. So the output HTML already has that in it. You&#8217;re not using JavaScript to rewrite what&#8217;s already been written, so it speeds things up as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:39] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yes, yes. You have less requests because there&#8217;s no file that you are requesting. There&#8217;s no waiting on, you know, everything to load. And to rewrite it, it&#8217;s just going right there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s the same process though. The way that you would do it in JavaScript, you&#8217;re now just transferring that into PHP, but the method that you&#8217;re using to do it would be the same, you know, search for the third child of this parent div, and then give it an extra class and that&#8217;s what happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:04] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. Yeah, that&#8217;s really straightforward. And really, really, really powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:09] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> It is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Because not only can you write your own thing in that way, but if you want to upend what&#8217;s already been written by, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s something strange in a plugin that you&#8217;ve downloaded. Would this be able to rewrite the things that the plugin is injecting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:23] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so you can, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s a plugin which does something quirky in the HTML, you don&#8217;t like it, you want to strip something out or add something in. It sits between where the plugin injects its code and where the end user receives the HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:35] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is interesting. So it&#8217;s a total rewrite of the HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:38] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:41] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yeah, and it&#8217;s fast. It&#8217;s actually working faster than when you would load JavaScript for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So in many cases it renders much of the JavaScript, the JavaScript that&#8217;s being used to modify the DOM. It completely negates the need for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:59] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Have you found it easy to learn this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:01] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s very easy. It&#8217;s even easier than Interactivity API. It&#8217;s just, you know, you instantiate the class, pass the string to it that you want to, you know, search for tags, and then you have methods. You call the method and loop through the things, or you don&#8217;t have to loop, depending what you are looking for. And there is a method, remove attribute, add attribute, remove class. You know, it&#8217;s that easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And, like everything in WordPress, you said earlier, it&#8217;s never finished. There&#8217;ll always be work done on it. But as of now, we&#8217;re recording this late February, 2025, is it pretty complete for all the things that you&#8217;ve wished to do? Does it have an answer for that, or is there still work to be done?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:42] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> The HTML processor needs to be optimised, so it&#8217;s not completely production ready yet. Tag processor is optimised and ready to use, and we actually used it in 2023. We waited for new release when it was coming into Core. We waited for two weeks and delayed the deployment to get it in to actually, because that example that I used for removing no-follow attribute from internal links, that&#8217;s the real world example that we had. And it was really annoying problem that was so easily fixed with five lines of code, once the HTML API got into Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I obsess about WordPress, like that&#8217;s all I think about most days basically, and yet this is somehow completely passed me by. The Interactivity API, somehow that captured my attention. There must have been some press release, or something to explain that this is happening. But the HTML API completely passed me by. I wonder if that&#8217;s just my lack of trying hard enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:46] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> No, that was actually the case for many people. So for that WordPress release, I was leading the documentation focus. So I know, I wrote the field guide, and I knew that was there. But many people didn&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that idea behind this new series of talks that I do. So to find these, it&#8217;s very good that these things come into Core slowly, like piece by piece. What is ready? What is optimised? But because they are small, people don&#8217;t hear about them, because we don&#8217;t advertise that. And Interactivity API is, it gets the same treatment as any other Gutenberg feature. Like, oh, it&#8217;s flashy, it&#8217;s new, come see this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But HTML API is completely PHP. It actually powers Interactivity API, but nobody knows that. And those were like small pieces getting in, because its purpose was to serve Gutenberg. So it wasn&#8217;t really advertised as something you can use for other things. But you know developers, they find ways to use something for different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s why I wanted to create these talks to actually show people there are so many things you can do with WordPress now that are new. And you can use them today, and tomorrow they will be even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess with the Interactivity API you are solving a really hard problem. So to be able to modify one part of the page, it&#8217;s content and it&#8217;s a separate block, that&#8217;s a difficult thing to overcome. So there&#8217;s a lot of work to get over that. But if you just want to add a border to the third child of a div, everybody&#8217;s using the same JavaScript technique to do it. So there&#8217;s a well understood way of doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that, I suppose, leads to the question, what is the benefit over just using JavaScript? Why would we want to use the HTML API instead of just the familiar thing, which probably everybody&#8217;s doing, you know, just rewrite things with JavaScript. Is it basically coming down to ease of readability for everybody, and speed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:57] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yeah. I think if you take a look at, for example, enterprise projects. The way developers optimise the code, it&#8217;s like every piece of millisecond counts because these projects are huge, and they have a lot of visits. So if you can remove all the JavaScript, I mean, that&#8217;s huge. That is making such impact, and it brings you like 10 places before your competition. Doing just that is enough to use this over JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it replaces not just need for JavaScript, but need for regex as well. And again, in enterprise projects, when you have huge databases running regex and having potential to not work everywhere where it&#8217;s supposed to work, as opposed to this, that is very straightforward. Not too many lines of code, and it&#8217;s actually faster. You would take that chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I guess if you&#8217;ve just got like a five page brochure website, that&#8217;s for a mom and pop store, you&#8217;re probably not going to be worrying too much. But if you&#8217;ve got an enterprise page, you know, an enterprise level website which is maybe getting, I don&#8217;t know, 50,000 hits every hour or something like that. Shaving 10 milliseconds out, multiply that by 50,000, I mean, not only is it quicker, so Google likes it, but also the cost of everything goes down. You know, there&#8217;s less bits flying across the internet. It&#8217;s all been optimised. And I guess at the enterprise level, all of those things matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:36] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yeah, everything matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s fascinating, genuinely fascinating, and something that I&#8217;d never heard of. So I will go and, when I&#8217;ve edited this podcast, I&#8217;ll go and preach the gospel of the HTML and Interactivity APIs. That&#8217;s everything I wanted to ask. Milana, is there anything that you wanted to get across that I didn&#8217;t ask?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:53] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No. In that case, Milana Cap, thank you very much for chatting to me today. Really appreciate it. I hope you enjoy the rest of your time in Manila.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:01] <strong>Milana Cap:</strong> Yeah, thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;re very welcome.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Milana Cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milana is a seasoned WordPress Engineer from Serbia, working with XWP and freelancing through Toptal. She&#8217;s not just a developer; she&#8217;s also active in WordPress community roles such as a co-rep for the documentation team, organiser at multiple WordCamps, and a member of the plugin review team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss some groundbreaking WordPress features that developers should be aware of, specifically focusing on her presentation at WordCamp Asia in Manila titled &#8220;WordPress gems for developers: fresh new features you&#8217;ll actually want to use.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start the discussion with the Interactivity API. Milana explains how this feature allows blocks within WordPress to communicate seamlessly with one another. Until now, most blocks were just silos of information, they could not communicate with one another. This API enables developers to manage interactivity across multiple blocks without resorting to custom solutions. We talk about some possible use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milana also gets into the HTML API, which underpins the Interactivity API. This empowers developers to manipulate HTML attributes using PHP, thereby reducing the reliance on JavaScript. This not only enhances page load speeds but also simplifies the code management process. It’s not something that I’d heard of, but Milana explains how important it can be in rewriting the DOM for whatever goals you have in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the episode, Milana shares examples of these APIs in action, demonstrating how they can simplify and optimise WordPress development projects, particularly at an enterprise level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer looking to leverage these new WordPress features, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Milana&#8217;s presentation at WordCamp Asia 2025: <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/session/wordpress-gems-for-devs-fresh-new-features-youll-actually-want-to-use/\">WordPress gems for devs: fresh new features you’ll actually want to use</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://xwp.co/\">XWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/\">Toptal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpmovies.dev/\">Interactivity API preview</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/55642\">Interactivity API showcase #55642</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/09/the-html-api-process-your-tags-not-your-pain/\">The HTML API: process your tags, not your pain</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://2024.phpsrbija.rs/\">PHP Serbia 2024</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"Do The Woo Community: The Do the Woo Release Notes Newsletter on LinkedIn\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://dothewoo.io/?post_type=blog&p=94001\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/the-do-the-woo-release-notes-newsletter-on-linkedin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:128:\"If you are on LinkedIn and looking for a deeper look into our episodes as they are released, we have a newsletter there for you.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 10:39:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.8 Release Candidate 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=18673\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/04/wordpress-6-8-release-candidate-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8482:\"<p>The third release candidate (“RC3”) for WordPress 6.8 is ready for download and testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;

That&#8217;s the power of Gravatar. Since 2004, we have been quietly revolutionizing online identity, offering a consistent way to represent yourself across the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> stands for Globally Recognized Avatar. It&#8217;s a free profile for the web that uses your email address as its core identification system. This clever approach lets you maintain a single avatar and profile that follows you across major platforms like <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept is simple but powerful. Instead of creating separate profiles on dozens of websites, Gravatar centralizes your online identity. With over 8.6 billion avatar requests served daily, it&#8217;s become an essential part of the online experience for millions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, Gravatar has expanded beyond just avatars Now, integrated websites can pull complete profile information from your Gravatar account. This improves the profile creation and onboarding processes, saving time and reducing friction when joining new platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/getting-started/\"><img width=\"3242\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/gravatar_integration_cta.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2632\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From scattered profiles to unified presence: How Gravatar works</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, Gravatar uses your email address as a unique identifier. When you comment on a blog or join a platform that supports Gravatar, the system looks up your email to find your profile information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry about privacy concerns. Gravatar doesn&#8217;t simply expose your email address to every website. Instead, it converts your email into a <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/api/avatars/hash/\">secure hash</a> – essentially a one-way code that protects your actual address while still creating a consistent identifier. This technical conversion ensures your email stays private while allowing the system to recognize you across different sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one of Gravatar&#8217;s most powerful features is its synchronization capability. Update your profile once, and the change instantly reflects across millions of integrated websites through the <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/\">Gravatar API</a>. This eliminates the hassle of updating dozens of separate profiles when you change your photo or information.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1328\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/update-once-sync-everywhere.png\" alt=\"Gravatar “Update Once, Sync Everywhere” feature\" class=\"wp-image-3021\" />\n\n\n\n<p>For professionals, this creates an efficient way to build and maintain a <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2025/01/10/personal-branding-social-media/\">consistent online persona</a>. Want separate identities for work and personal activities? Simply create different Gravatars using different email addresses. This separation gives you complete control over how you present yourself in various contexts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine never having to repeatedly upload profile pictures or maintain consistent information across multiple platforms. That&#8217;s the advantage Gravatar provides – centralized profile management that simplifies your online presence while maintaining your privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each time you visit a new website that supports Gravatar, your profile information automatically appears – no duplicate accounts, no forgotten passwords, and no inconsistent branding. Your carefully crafted online identity follows you seamlessly across the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the best part? Claiming your Gravatar is completely free. Let&#8217;s walk through how to set one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Setting up your Gravatar account: A step-by-step guide</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Visit the <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar website</a> and click “<em>Get Started Now.</em>”</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1381\" height=\"971\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/get-started-now-gravatar.png\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage and “Get Started Now” button\" class=\"wp-image-3023\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Enter your email address.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"455\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/create-your-profile-page-gravatar.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar: “Create your Profile” page\" class=\"wp-image-3024\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Check your inbox for a verification code, and enter it on the page.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"411\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gravatar-welcome-email.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar confirmation email for a created account\" class=\"wp-image-3025\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you already have a <a href=\"http://wordpress.com\">WordPress.com</a> account, Gravatar will ask, “<em>Would you like to log in to Gravatar using your WordPress.com account?</em>” Saying yes speeds up the process by using your existing information. If you don&#8217;t have a WordPress.com account, you can create one through Gravatar.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"452\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/profile-settings-wordpress-com.png?w=660\" alt=\"WordPress.com profile settings with Gravatar information\" class=\"wp-image-3026\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Next, upload a profile photo.

Once configured, your Gravatar becomes your digital passport, making it faster to join new communities and ensuring consistent recognition across the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that your profile is publicly visible by default, so only include information you&#8217;re comfortable sharing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Optimizing your Gravatar profile for maximum impact</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve set up your basic Gravatar account, let&#8217;s look at ways to enhance its effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Profile photo</strong>: Choose a high-quality, professional image that represents you appropriately. For business purposes, a clear headshot with good lighting and a neutral background works best. If you prefer not to use your photo, a recognizable brand logo is a good alternative. Just ensure the image is clear and easily identifiable, even at smaller sizes, as a lot of people browse from their mobile.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bio and details</strong>: Craft a concise, compelling bio that highlights your expertise, experience, and unique value. Focus on what makes you stand out and what your audience would find most relevant. Keep it brief but impactful – think of it as your elevator pitch in written form.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Social media and links</strong>: Add your verified social media accounts and links to your website or portfolio. This turns your Gravatar into a customizable <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/11/08/creating-a-digital-business-card/\">digital business card</a>. You can also take advantage of the <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2025/02/06/bluesky-handle/\">integration between Bluesky and Gravatar</a>, which allows you to use your Gravatar domain as your Bluesky handle for a consistent online identity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/domain-updated-confirmation.png?w=660\" alt=\"Bluesky profile with a custom domain from Gravatar\" class=\"wp-image-3030\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Privacy settings</strong>: Control what information is visible by accessing your <a href=\"https://support.gravatar.com/profiles/profile-access/\">Account Privacy Settings</a> or the individual sections.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"339\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/verified-profiles-privacy-settings.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar profile: Adjusting the privacy settings for the “Verified accounts” section\" class=\"wp-image-3031\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In the general settings, you can choose to hide your public avatar, make your profile private, or discourage search engines from indexing your profile. This flexibility lets you balance visibility with privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gravatar-general-privacy-settings.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar profile general privacy settings\" class=\"wp-image-3032\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, you only need a little bit of effort, and you can end up with a well-optimized Gravatar profile that helps you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Build professional credibility across multiple platforms.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Establish a higher degree of online trust with your audience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/16/how-to-network-at-a-conference/\">Create networking opportunities</a> whenever you interact online (and offline too!)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Using Gravatar with WordPress and beyond</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar has been <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/12/10/how-to-use-gravatar-in-wordpress/\">deeply integrated with WordPress</a> since 2007, when it was acquired by <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> (WordPress.com&#8217;s parent company). This acquisition created a strong connection between these platforms that continues to benefit users today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When someone with a Gravatar profile comments or posts on a WordPress site, the system automatically pulls their Gravatar profile to display as the author.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gravatar-comment-section.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a comment section with a Gravatar user\" class=\"wp-image-3034\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This creates a consistent visual identity across WordPress blogs without requiring users to set up separate profiles on each site they visit. Your professional image follows you throughout the WordPress ecosystem, helping readers recognize you across different blogs and publications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Site owners can easily customize how avatars appear on their WordPress sites through the dashboard under <em>Settings &gt; Discussion</em>. This section allows administrators to enable or disable avatars, select maximum ratings (G, PG, R, X), and choose default avatars for users without Gravatars. Options range from generic silhouettes to generated patterns based on email addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/default-avatar-settings.png?w=660\" alt=\"Default Avatar options in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-3035\" />\n\n\n\n<p>But Gravatar extends well beyond WordPress. Major platforms like GitHub, Slack, and OpenAI also use Gravatar to provide consistent user images across their services. This widespread adoption means your professional identity remains cohesive across much of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The greatest benefit comes from Gravatar&#8217;s central management approach: Update your profile once, and those changes sync across all connected platforms. Whether you&#8217;ve changed jobs, updated your headshot, or refined your bio, you only need to make these changes in one place. This saves valuable time and ensures your brand presentation remains consistent no matter where your online activities take you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Privacy and security: Managing your digital identity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar gives you strong privacy controls to manage your digital identity. You can choose exactly which profile details to share publicly and which to keep private, so you always know who can see your data. Besides the settings you can adjust for yourself, Gravatar uses industry-standard measures like HTTPS to keep your data safe as it travels across the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, even with these protections, it&#8217;s still a good idea to maintain separate profiles for work and your personal life. Using different email addresses for your work and personal Gravatars creates a helpful separation that prevents people from connecting different parts of your life. This approach also lets you customize privacy settings for each email address – keeping your professional presence polished while maintaining personal privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Gravatar&#8217;s key benefits is that it helps <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/12/02/how-can-you-manage-your-digital-footprint/\">minimize your overall digital footprint</a>. Instead of creating and managing accounts across dozens of websites and platforms (each with potential security vulnerabilities), you only need to update your personal information in one central location. This reduces your exposure to data breaches while ensuring your public-facing information remains accurate and up-to-date across the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Create your free Gravatar profile in minutes</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to claim your digital identity? Getting started with Gravatar takes just a few minutes but establishes your online presence across thousands of websites instantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to get your Gravatar profile up and running:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Visit Gravatar.com and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/log-in/link?client_id=1854&redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic-api.wordpress.com%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3D1854%26response_type%3Dcode%26blog_id%3D0%26state%3De16ed5decdc4260b151f46a6b7985daacc2cede87b1b9ec77e24420ddd91dfa3%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgravatar.com%252Fconnect%252F%253Faction%253Drequest_access_token%26gravatar_from%3Dsignup%26from-calypso%3D1&gravatar_from=signup\">click “Get Started Now.”</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create a new account or sign in with your existing WordPress.com credentials.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Upload your chosen profile image – select something professional that represents you well.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Complete your profile by adding a compelling bio.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Connect your social media accounts and verify important links or services.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>With this single action, you&#8217;ll join millions of users on WordPress.com, GitHub, Slack, and other major platforms with your new globally recognized avatar.

In today&#8217;s episode we will talk about WordPress 6.8, The Source of Truth, the Field Guide, Gutenberg 20.5 and Gutenberg 20.6, and a few other things, little things in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times, and a developer advocate working for Automattic. And it&#8217;s a great privilege for me to have with me, JC Palmes, who is the engineering manager at Web Dev Studios, again on the show. JC was also the local co-lead of this year&#8217;s WordCamp Asia in the Philippines, and it was a great WordCamp. So, congratulations. So glad you made it today, JC, how are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> I&#8217;m doing great. And, actually, my role changed since we&#8217;ve last had this. Yeah, so I&#8217;m now the principal technical manager at Web Dev Studios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Congratulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Thank you. But yeah, I&#8217;m happy to be back. And things have been good, very busy, but the good kind. I&#8217;ve been deep in block themes again, so I&#8217;m excited about this episode. So, I&#8217;ve seen there&#8217;s a lot of cool stuff in 6.8 in the recent Gutenberg release I think developers like me will appreciate, especially those who are building for clients and working with starter themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, absolutely. So, the first time you were on the show was last September in Episode 108, and you had just released the first version of the WSD, W-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> WDS-BT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; WDS-BT, yes, I&#8217;ll get it right, block starter theme, and we discussed it on the show. And after using it for half a year now, how are you doing with it, and what have you learned?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Yeah, so it&#8217;s been a great journey since then. After six months, was it really just six months, of using and refining WDS-BT in real client projects, I&#8217;ve learned a lot about what engineers need from a starter theme, especially when working with the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;ve recently released Version 1.1, and most of the updates were based on feedback from our team, lessons from actual use in client sites, and one of the biggest things we focused on was making it easier to generate blocks and patterns consistently using our internal script, which is now part of BT as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s all documented in the README if any developers out there want to try it out. So, this really helps streamline development for everyone. And we also have a demo site so that clients and internal teams and Sales can preview how the theme behaves out of the block. It&#8217;s been really helpful for onboarding and for setting clear expectations early on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I can imagine that, yes, and with the scripts now. So, you just said you had two scripts. One is to create custom blocks, and the other one to patterns. That&#8217;s the first time that I&#8217;ve heard about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes</em>: Oh, sorry. Well, not&#8230; So, we have an internal script. So, BT is part of our other repo that helps us create a client site from scratch. And what that does is, there&#8217;s a script that I&#8217;ve added in where we can create a theme based on WDS-BT in five minutes, and it goes through all the process in the terminal, and then, after that, you have a full website theme working, a block theme working as is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other one, which is part of BT, is in creating scaffolding blocks. So, BT comes with a block theme template that is baked into our custom webpack config. That webpack config is defaulting on WordPress config still, but we did add in a bit more flavor to it based on our use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, of course, yeah, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s for, yeah, to adopt it, yeah. So, wonderful. So, dear listeners, we will share the links, one is to the theme, and also, to the demo site, in the show notes so you can test it out and see if it could also be your starter theme for your clients, and at least gives you…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, that would be awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; and gives you some inspiration for that. And I&#8217;m always looking for inspiration about how people approach a topic, so I&#8217;m glad that you and your company share so much online and build it in public, and also, shared quite a few blog posts about it, not only about your theme, but also your approach on getting clients work from a classic theme, and then, gradually go block-based.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I just listened to Brad Williams on the Press blog with Steve Birch. He interviewed him. So, I share that video as well in the show notes, and it starts out with what the approach is or how they approach it in terms of guiding clients through a block-based journey there when they were so happy with the other thing, yeah. And it starts at 20 minutes to get really into that. So, that was a really good conversation as well, with Steve Birch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Contributions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, we don&#8217;t have any announcement or listener questions today, but we have a few things that are community contributions or that I&#8217;ve selected, and one is pretty much the same topic. Kevin Devon and Mark Wilkinson from Highrise Digital, an agency in UK, shared their theme-building strategy for a school project at the London WordPress meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was really insightful to see how these experienced theme creators use the site editor to build a theme, and then, let the client fully customize, also, their sites. They actually go pretty deep and show what block that they hide from the school, what block variations on the embeds that they hide, and how to do that. They even shared some code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it was quite fast-paced, but video, you can just stop it and listen to it again, and all that. Yeah, so it&#8217;s called Building a Block-based WordPress Site with FSE. Yeah, they also went pretty detailed in what kind of custom blocks they did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they actually didn&#8217;t program them themselves, they used ACF because of the data entry screens as well. So, they only did two. The rest was all core stuff, yeah. So, it&#8217;s really cool to see how that works out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> I&#8217;ll have to check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, they do some great work at Highrise Digital as well. And I have three more videos, so to speak, or tasks for you, dear listeners. So, three well-known developers in the community continue with their live streams. They started either this year or long before, but Jonathan Bossenger, many know from the developer courses at Learn WordPress, has been learning working with AI, and he shares it, be it wins or losses, on the live stream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this week he tried to find out, can AI fix my Plugin Check issues? So, Plugin Check is a plugin that you install on your site when you develop a plugin, and then run through all the checks that the plugin review team has built so you are ahead of the curve when you submit it to the WordPress repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not only good for when you submit it to the repository, it definitely helps you, also, with your own, even if you just give it to your clients also to beef up, check out some of the issues that are always problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I cannot say because that&#8217;s a secret. No, you need to check it out themselves, how good he was, how good it worked for him. And the second one is JuanMa Garrido, he is from Spain, and is also a developer advocate at Automattic, and he shared live stream sessions in Spanish and English, not at the same time, of course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; me speaking Spanish, but no, he has one week he does this in Spanish, and the next week he does something else in English. So, that&#8217;s quite a good thing for the Spanish community as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he recently livestreamed going through the Data Layers Course on Learn.WordPress and built the app in public, and goes through, not all lines of code, but he explains the concepts behind that, even&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, sometimes you need somebody to walk you through things so it actually clicks in your mind a bit, and that&#8217;s what JuanMa Garrido did. And then, Ryan Welcher is the pioneer of livestreaming…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JC Palmes: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; in WordPress, and he&#8217;s done it for, I think, almost three years, if not longer. And he livestreams every Thursday at 2:30 PM, UTC, on Thursdays, unless he&#8217;s on a meetup or at a WordCamp or on holiday. And he has been, recently, working on adding user profiles and user interactions to his Block Developer Cookbook, which is the base of all his workshops where he has a few recipes that he walks through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In live events or in-person events like WordCamps, people can vote on which recipe should be talked about. And so, it was quite interesting to see at the workshop at WordCamp Asia last year and this year, because every event is different, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> I missed that one. I wanted to be there, but with being a local lead organizer for WordCamp Asia, you can&#8217;t really be on the sessions that you want to be just because there&#8217;s a lot going on on the, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And unfortunately, workshops are not recorded, as far as I can tell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; because they&#8217;re also too long, yeah, and they are not a&#8230; So, a talk, when it&#8217;s recorded, it&#8217;s, most of the time, fast-moving because you only have 30 minutes or something like that, but when you have a workshop that is 75 minutes, it is a lot of downtime in the end. It&#8217;s moving at a glacial pace when you sit at home at YouTube. So, I totally get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can check it out. We&#8217;ll share the Block Developer Cookbook repo in the site, in the show notes. So, you can definitely check it out. And maybe you want to get on the live stream with Ryan or JuanMa or Jonathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, we&#8217;ll see what we can do about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, JC, what are the places that you watch for learning new stuff?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, so I usually keep an eye on a few key places. The Make WordPress Core blog is, of course, a go-to because it&#8217;s where most of the important updates and demos get posted first, officially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also follow what&#8217;s happening on the Gutenberg and WordPress GitHub repos, because the discussions there give a good sense of what&#8217;s being built and why certain decisions are made. There&#8217;s a lot there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, I check Learn WordPress pretty regularly, too, especially the developer workshops. I also stay actively lurking in Slack, mostly in Core Editor and Design. I try to catch Ryan&#8217;s live stream, always, when I have time, when I can, but I usually end up just going through the recorded ones on YouTube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> But yeah, they&#8217;re really great for seeing how things work in practice. And I read a lot of blogs, too. I can&#8217;t give you the list of the blogs that I read just because I don&#8217;t have a particular list. I just try to search for something that&#8217;s interesting based on the conversations in GitHub, and then, read through all the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, excellent. Well, thank you so much for walking us through that. Yeah, I found the good with Gutenberg GitHub repo, really, there is so much there that it&#8217;s really hard to zone in on or zero in on the things that you, right now, need or wanted to explore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, tracking issues are really good, and there is now a label that says Tracking Issues so you can see the history of a feature, how it worked out, or what&#8217;s in the pipeline. Of course, with the contributions being reduced, it&#8217;s going to be a little shorter…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; or less features coming in, but sometimes it&#8217;s a good thing that there is a slower pace so everybody can catch up where they are. And I feel the same, yeah. I get the opportunity to dive a little deeper in all the things, although I was already, I have been quite deep into it, yeah. But if you don&#8217;t practice the skills to&#8230; it&#8217;s just superficial, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.8 RC 2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> But talking about the Make Core blog, WordPress 6.8 is in Release Candidate 2, and it&#8217;s only about 11 days away from final release. So, if you haven&#8217;t tested 6.8, now it&#8217;s really time, and you need to carve out a few hours to make sure that your themes and plugins actually work at the sites, work with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, of course, helps when you have a standardized system so you only have to check, mostly, one site, and then, some exceptions. But yeah, go and test it a bit. The Field Guide has the whole list of it, but it&#8217;s also a little bit overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we can go through some of the dev notes that are in there, and we also have a link to The Source of Truth for the details on the block editor. So, the list of dev notes, I only had three or four stars in there. Now, you have all the stars in there. That&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, to explain that to our listeners, I had the list of dev notes, and I put an emoji star to it and said, &#8220;Okay, JC, let me know which one you want to talk about, and then we&#8217;ll kind of have&#8230;&#8221; And she checked all of them. It&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> I did add in the smiley face to the ones that I think are really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So, I think that one of the major features coming on 6.8, I don&#8217;t know you how you feel about it, but for me it&#8217;s the speculative loading in 6.8, and it has such a great history because it comes out of a feature plugin that already had 50,000 installs in the last couple of years. So, what is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, speculative loading leads to near-instant page load times by loading the URLs that users might navigate to them already in the background. And the feature relies on an API that is now supported by many browsers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s called the Speculation Rules API, and it&#8217;s a platform feature so you can define the rules for which kinds of URL to pre-fetch or pre-render, and how early such speculative loading should occur. So, that&#8217;s in a nutshell, and has a lot of technical implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> I&#8217;m looking forward to this. This is one of the features that I really like, because I&#8217;ve been testing. So, for those who are using block themes, if you&#8217;re not, you should, speculative loading is already, it&#8217;s helping your site feel faster. You don&#8217;t have to enable anything, it&#8217;s just built in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, just to add into what you mentioned about speculative loading, what it does is preload pages users are likely to visit next based on how they interact with the site. So, when they actually click the page, the next page is ready and it loads almost instantly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, it speeds up, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah. What I really like about it is that it improves performance without adding too much complexity. There&#8217;s no JavaScript to manage, no extra setup. It just quietly does its job in the background. And it&#8217;s one of those features that makes the experience better for users while keeping it very simple for developers, which I really like. Always a win in my book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes, yes, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Make it easy for me, yes, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s a win for you, but it&#8217;s also a win for the clients because their visitors are benefiting from that without any additional investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, that&#8217;s the beauty of a WordPress open source system, that a lot of people work on it, and a few things just come with an update without costing a whole lot of money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> But let&#8217;s go a little bit back to the block editor. The first thing is that the global styles are now actually available from the left side of the screen, yeah. So, you have everything that you need reachable from the black navigation bar, and you don&#8217;t have to switch from one side to the next. Yeah, you can all do it in there, which is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> That always trips me up. Having to go from left to right when having it on one side just makes total sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes. Yeah. And what also started to, from in there, is that you can now also get the style book from there. And it&#8217;s a little bit more intuitive because when you click on the typography, you see, in the style book, all the blocks that have text in them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you go to images or, what is it, no, color, then you know all the blocks that have color settings in them, which are quite a few now, but it&#8217;s easier to zero down on a problem or on a concern, kind of, &#8220;Let&#8217;s look at our images,&#8221; or, &#8220;Let&#8217;s look at our paragraphs,&#8221; or, &#8220;What are the styles for it,&#8221; and all that. So, it&#8217;s all there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the user can actually change some of the global styles to switch out for their sites. If they don&#8217;t like the green of the button, they can make it darker or make it blue or make it pink, and make it for the whole site. So, it&#8217;s an instant replacement there. So, I really like the global styles to be a little bit more accessible for my brain. Speaking of a style book, it&#8217;s now also available for classic themes…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; which was a long time coming, or when the style book came to block themes, it was an early request from theme developers to get it also for the classic theme, and that finally comes with WordPress 6.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s one of the features that I added a smiley on, because that&#8217;s big. So, having classic themes or hybrid themes able to access the style book is going to help a lot for those who are still on the fence about going full block, although they should, but it gives them that experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right, yeah. And also, the controls, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, it&#8217;s an easing into the modern WordPress world, although there&#8217;s nothing wrong with staying on classic themes, but it&#8217;s so much nicer to work with a block editor, yeah. So, one of the confusions that has surfaced with the block theme is the confusion that, am I editing, now, a template, or am I adding a content page or grading a content page?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it took about, I think, a couple of years to figure out, and I am not there yet, we are not there yet, but to make that easier too, because the whole concept of templates was something that WordPress users, before, had no touch points. It was all in code and it was all for the developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And unless the theme developer had a customizer, there was no need to think about templates, all that. But now, that concept has arrived at the user, and to get this right in the brain, it&#8217;s sometimes really hard. And now, they have added a switch to show the template in the editor or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what that gives you is, when you grade a post and you click on the Show Template, you see where the featured image is and all the post content areas, and know, okay, when you click on the preview, it will show you, also, the whole page. Not only when you go to preview, but already in the editor, you see the whole page with header and footer and featured image and all that shows up. It takes the surprise out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And the same with pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> If you say there&#8217;s a switch that just gets toggled on when you see everything outlined for you, because that just makes things less confusing. So, this is a good move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And the switch is in the preview tab, in the top toolbar, when you click on the preview, then you see that tab has changed, it has additional features now. So, plugin developers, your email newsletter person plugin can see the email from your post if you needed to, and there is also the show template off and on. It&#8217;s just a check mark. And it&#8217;s really nice, yeah. And it goes together with a Zoom Out view. The Zoom Out view is nothing new with 6.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It has been introduced to WordPress through 6.7, very rudimentary, but when you add a pattern to your page, it goes automatically to Zoom Out. So, you see more of it and you see the whole composition of it. Now, in the toolbar of that particular section or pattern that you just added, you can change the styles, if there are any, from the theme, and you can change the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you have a call-to-action pattern, clicking on Change Design gives you the other patterns that are call-to-actions, or in the same category, and if you click that little drop that&#8217;s in the toolbar…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; yeah, you can browse through the styles for that particular call-to-action. And then, the Twenty-Twenty-Five theme, that&#8217;s actually quite nicely done. So, the developers of Twenty-Twenty-Five made a real good design system so you can just go through the color patterns for a particular section. It&#8217;s really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the option gives you only a few block options. So, in the tool block toolbar you see those two features, and in the dropdown of the three dots, you only get four options, that&#8217;s copy, cut, duplicate, and delete. There&#8217;s nothing else to do there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I found, yeah, it&#8217;s still a discussion if it&#8217;s a bug or not. For me, it&#8217;s a bug, but other people find it, well, maybe it should be like that is, when you switch off the show template-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Mm-hmm?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; it also switches off the possibility of zoom view, because the zoom view is on a certain element in the template, the main element, and if that&#8217;s not there, the zoom view does not show. So, if you are waiting for the zo…m view to come in because you added a pattern, you need to just check Show Template…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Check Show Template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; yeah, switch on Show Template, and then you get it back. Or you could use&#8230; Oh no, that&#8217;s the wrong one. I thought that was a shortcut, but the shortcut is not for the template, it&#8217;s for the Zoom Out view, and it&#8217;s shift + control + 0 to get the Zoom Out view, but only when Show Template is checked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yes. That sounds like a bug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes. And I&#8217;m sharing that bug with you all so you can chime in. It&#8217;s an interesting discussion. Because it&#8217;s two different things. In my brain it&#8217;s two different things, and they shouldn&#8217;t be covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, completely two different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> They&#8217;re not the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you. Well, the design tools, well, then 6.6 they started, and then, 6.7, they continued with it, and 6.8, I think, is pretty far that every block has all the design tools it needs. So, color options, border options, dimensions are now available for almost every block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a dev note called the Roster of Design Tools per block, and you get a table with all the blocks in the list and which kind of feature they have and not have so you can&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Oh, that&#8217;s nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; a fast check, yeah. But it could use a few more features, like, the header comes down, but with the theme right now, it&#8217;s not possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> We have a pretty sweet table style in DEL, BT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, okay. Well, I&#8217;ll see if I can replicate the full table and put it somewhere where I have access to plugins, because on the Make blog, yeah, there&#8217;s not a whole lot of…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; the plugins all need to be tested and approved, and all that. So, did you get a chance to look at the Details block, changes there? Detail blocks was introduced, I think, in 6.7, I think, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, I&#8217;ve been using the Details block mostly as an accordion FAQs…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> &#8230; but this time around, I have not played around with the Details block when I was testing in 6.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, there are three different features that&#8230; So, one is that, if you have a list of the same things that you want to be controlled together, then you can give each one of the items, each Details block, so you have a set of three Details blocks and they&#8217;re all FAQs, for instance, so you can give them, in the the Advanced section, there is a Name Attributes field, and if you give them the name attribute, each one of them the same, then via CSS, you can control those at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what also happens is that, when one opens, the other one closes, and vice versa. So, it feels more like a unit for that. And you see it that the FAQ thing, oh, I used FAQ here in the example, in the Source of Truth, and you see that it&#8217;s then attached in the CSS in the name field. So, they&#8217;re identically named, and then they&#8217;ve…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> That is a good one. So, we&#8217;ve usually added in a script to handle opening and closing the Details block as an accordion. So, having this baked in is big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes. And you can actually do it with a&#8230; a content creator can do this. So, the same developer can&#8230; yeah. So, this is really nice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> This is nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Then, what&#8217;s also nice is that the summary content, like the question for an FAQ, for instance, is then also shown in the list view of the block editor so you can identify which one you&#8217;re working with. That&#8217;s so nice because that helps quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And then, you can also create anchor links for each block so you can separately link to them from other places, and developers have a chance to modify the Allow blocks attribute to make sure that only the right blocks are used in a Details block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there are quite a few things in there that makes it&#8230; I think that&#8217;s one of the biggest changes for WordCamp 6.8. When I was testing, I said, &#8220;Oh, this is neat. Oh, this is neat,&#8221; kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, I like that, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> I like that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And then, the other things, some of the changes on the blocks are minimal, but still, quality of life changes. So, the Gallery block now has one link, or one way to put the link to open bigger…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yes, because having to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; and not for every…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> &#8230; do it on every single image when you&#8217;ve had more than 10 images there is not nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I would have said two, I would have said two images. If you have more than two, you don&#8217;t want to do this for every image, but yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> I&#8217;m a bit patient with galleries just because, but know 10 is my max, so&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. No, but that is really good that you, just going through the tool while make sure they have the gallery parent, select it, go in the toolbar, and then you can select the Enable click to expand. The image block now has a feature, has a way from the blocks settings that you can, when you load it into your post, that you can say, &#8220;Okay, make this image my featured image,&#8221; and you don&#8217;t have to delete it and then load it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You still need to delete it if you don&#8217;t want it doubling up on your post. When you display featured images with a single post template, then you have that image in twice. But yeah, kicking out or deleting a block is easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah. But that update is a subtle but powerful workflow update because there&#8217;s no need to switch context, just to set a featured image. That saves time if you have to do it more than twice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. If you do two posts a day for every day, you&#8217;re really happy about that type of saver, yeah. And you don&#8217;t have to think for it so much, yeah. Because a lot of people have a website that does really nice things with featured image, but it falls down when they forget the featured image there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is something that they might&#8230; It prevents that people post something without the featured image. And then, the image block also has some handling. You can crop things and you can, well, mostly crop, or what else can you do with an image block, I forgot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Mostly crop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Resize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And now, you actually know that things happen because there are little notifications on the bottom of the screen that, &#8220;Oh, yes, we had to crop this,&#8221; yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yes. That always trips me up because when you crop an image, I always have to double-check, &#8220;Was it really cropped?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8220;Did it work,&#8221; yeah. And I hate that question, &#8220;Did this work,&#8221; or, &#8220;What happened,&#8221; yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah. You just know it works when you look at the URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> It actually looks different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it does, yeah. So, the Query Loop block, have you seen what&#8217;s coming in with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> So, this Query Loop block change is actually something that we, I guess, this is something that we wanted to fix way back. So, that is, that hasn&#8217;t been part of WDS-BT. It&#8217;s fixing WDS-BT, but with 6.8 having the same fix, I will have to remove that fix so that we&#8217;ll have the default one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Which feature are you…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> It&#8217;s a long time coming. The sticky post for a Query Loop block where it&#8217;s adding in not being counted when you set a&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, there are two things. One was already in there. It excludes the sticky posts. But now, there&#8217;s a new…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> They ignore one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>They ignore one, yeah, where you can&#8230; And that means that the sticky part of that post is ignored, and it will behave like the other filters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Like, if you do it by date or you do it by category or by tag, or something like that, it&#8217;s not sticking up on top on any of those sites. So, it&#8217;s a little hard. So, &#8220;excluding&#8221; means, none of the sticky posts are showing, and &#8220;ignore the sticky post&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean ignore the sticky post, it ignores the sticky part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> It&#8217;s having them go back to just a usual post not being counted as sticky, because sticky is sticky, it sticks to the front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, or the top, or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, at the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So, there&#8217;s also a sorting option by page. So, for pages, you now can order by page order, in ascending order or in descending order. So, if you have pages and have parents, and then you have that, or have it in a certain order, the Query Loop can be sorted by that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when you want to show them in a&#8230; Why would you do that? Oh, if you&#8217;re in navigation, or something like that, or it&#8217;s some pages and you want it all in the same, in a real good order there. So, that&#8217;s certainly something that&#8217;s new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, that is new. Usually, when we need to do that same order by, we usually do it custom just so we&#8217;re able to do it that way. So, this is huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I really like it because I had, often, use cases where they had a parent page about a certain topic, and then, sub-pages that go deeper into it, and they all needed to be on one page, and had featured images so you can really do nice grids, but if they&#8217;re in a different order, it&#8230; So, you really want them in the right order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, get everybody confused. And then, there is another feature in there that comes out of the Zoom Out view, but it&#8217;s the button in the toolbar for the Query Loop, for the group block that holds everything together so you can change the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you grab a pattern for the Query Loop, and after thinking about it for two minutes you don&#8217;t like it, you don&#8217;t have to throw it out again. You just click on Change Design, and then, you get a another list of the other possibilities how you can put it together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, I like the Change Design link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> It&#8217;s a game changer. You don&#8217;t have to&#8230; Again, it&#8217;s a quality of life&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Absolutely, yeah. And you can now get the Query Loop for pages for all levels. Yeah, so you can say, &#8220;Okay, on the main page, I only want the sub-pages to show, but not the main page,&#8221; kind of thing. Yeah. And so, it&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And The Source of Truth as well as the PR, they had an example query, so you can test it out, a pattern there. So, you can go through that. Yeah, that was the Query block, right? So, next thing is the new block, the Query Total block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And it just shows the number of posts or pages in that particular query, and you can also add it to the pagination, or something like that, 10 of 12 kinds of things you get there as well. And it&#8217;s quite nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> One functionality that I need to recheck to see how that…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Recheck on your theme, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I can imagine, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> That is built in as well. There&#8217;s a lot of updates in 6.8 that we fixed in BT that we have now to retest…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Remove.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> &#8230; and remove as needed, which is quite nice, because it&#8217;s all going to be default functionality now. You don&#8217;t have to fight against the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And you have somebody else maintaining that part of the code?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Right now it&#8217;s me and whoever is available at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s the whole set of contributors that-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Oh, yeah, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; maintain that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And you don&#8217;t have to think about, &#8220;Oh, we had a customization there, so let&#8217;s figure that out.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, while that was all going on in the release cycle and I was talking about things, I got a question that people who had a hard time finding or making sure that the Query Total block shows up, they couldn&#8217;t find it, it only shows up when you&#8217;re inside the Query Loop. It&#8217;s similar to the pagination. So, if you&#8217;re outside the Query Loop in your canvas, it doesn&#8217;t show up in the inserter because it has nowhere to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Yeah, it has nowhere to connect to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right, yeah. Well, you and I know that, but it&#8217;s not an easy concept for people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>I have to always think about that because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> &#8230; sometimes I just think in the developer mindset. So, it&#8217;s a switch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, and sometimes it&#8217;s just surprising what is clear to me or others in the field. A new user or another content creator says, &#8220;How does that go? How does that work? I can&#8217;t find it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So, the Social icon has minimal changes, but one is that it now also has the Discord icon. So, if you want to link to your Discord profile or Discord server, you can do this in the Social icons block, and it now also has, you can use the arrow keys to navigate to the link. You don&#8217;t have to go twice on adding the URL to whatever new Social icon you added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>So, it&#8217;s really streamlining the process. Oh, I&#8217;ve just skipped over it. The Separator block can be, now, really expanded because you can add a different tag for it. The Separator block has only an HR tag until now…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> The HR, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; the horizontal line. And now, you can actually replace it in the advanced HTML element section of the block and make it a diff. So, then, all the CSS that you can do with any other diff, you can now apply to the Separator block, and makes it a nice, it can be a nice decorative tool for your theme and for your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think that transformation really helps with all that setting. Additional setting helps, really, with styling, adding more styling possibilities. I was just saying transformation…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> I guess we&#8217;ll be using the Separator block more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it can be interesting breaking up the wall of text when you have some decorative stuff there. I can see that, for instance, the little pattern things that you had in WordPress Asia website, that they could be a little bit more [inaudible 00:41:53] instead of just an image, or something like that, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I was talking about transformation there, but I was just reading Transformation. What you now can also do is transform a Separator block into a Spacer block. So, yeah, there&#8217;s also one of the workflow improvements that come with 6.8. I don&#8217;t know if we have to go through the editor changes, all of them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there are two new commands. One is, Add a New Page, and the other one is, I totally forgot. My God. Open the Site Editor. When you are somewhere in pages or something like that and you want to just go back, you don&#8217;t have to click 15 times to get back to the design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, you just do Open Site Editor, CTRL + K, and then, start with Site Editor, and it gives you the option already in the command palette that flows on top of your screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Oh, keyboard shortcuts too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>There are two new ones, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Pace, block styles with Command Control, and option…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> We didn&#8217;t&#8230; Yeah, that one. That set&#8217;s going to get heavy use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> From me at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> And then, that shortcut, you can now paste block styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You can copy-paste block styles over. That&#8217;s fast. You can really do that. So, the next thing, what I really like is, the Starter Content is now available for&#8230; You can switch that off. That&#8217;s the first thing. So, if you add a new page, it automatically comes with Starter Content, if the theme provides them, in a modal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That gets in the way to get started with what you want to do. Some people like it and some people don&#8217;t like it. It&#8217;s the 50-50 thing. But some people&#8230; So, you can switch it off. So, you can toggle that Show Starter Content Patterns off, and you can also change it in the Preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also find them in the categories of your patterns. It says Starter Content. So, if you do want to see them, you can just go there and get a list of the starter content for that particular post type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, that one I have not tested yet, but that will be useful for clients who have very particular styles for a custom post type. With the toggling on and off of that feature, is that available per custom post type or is that a global setting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s a global setting. Show Starter Content Patterns, that&#8217;s a global setting, but Starter Content, until 6.8, wasn&#8217;t available for other custom post types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, but now it is. So, you can, if you&#8217;re just in the header of the pattern, you say that&#8217;s also for your custom post types, when you do add new custom post type, it also shows the starter content, which wasn&#8217;t available before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely a good feature request for an enhancement to at least provide a filter for theme developers to switch it off for certain post types, and on for other posts. And speaking of theme developers, now you could have your patterns in different folders so it&#8217;s not all in the patterns folder, like, Twenty-Twenty-Five has, I don&#8217;t know, 80 patterns in one folder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> A lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Now, you can&#8230; And I had to do, with the name of the file, I had to sort it, like, H or CTA, dot, dot, dot. Now, you can have folders like Patterns, CTAs, and I&#8217;ll put them all in there, or Patterns and Testimonials, or something like that, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s a little bit more organized in your theme folder, and I really like that, yeah, because I&#8217;m also a fan to having separate style folders. So, I have styles for blocks and a style for other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s what we do with BT as well. So, styles are there included in folders if it&#8217;s words. I forgot what I was going to say. Yeah, just making sure that you have styles in the block folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>And being able to do that for patterns is…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Pretty organized, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> &#8230; yeah, that&#8217;s going to make things a lot more organized, because we don&#8217;t need more than 80 patterns in one single folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Maybe you don&#8217;t need any patterns, period, but some people actually, then, need them for a larger site…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; and then, you can sort it out through the folders, yeah. Because you have the categories, and if you make the categories also be your folders…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Your folders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; yeah, it helps. So, that was what I wanted to&#8230; Well, we talked a lot about the block editor kind of thing, but I really like that because it&#8217;s such a neat tool, and we need to dive in, sometimes, really deeper into the features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, for the developers, the Field Guide is out, and I definitely urge you to look at that and skim it at least for things that are interesting to you. There have been a ton of accessibility improvements, and Joe Dawson, the team rep of the Accessibility team has done a fine job putting that together so you can really see what has changed and what has been improved upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also some developer-related changes for the block editor in the miscellaneous block editor dev note. I think George Mamadashvili did that. He was also the editor tech lead for the release, or is, yeah. It&#8217;s not out yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it definitely also deals with deprecations of being experimental, coming stable, or deprecated kind of thing. So, you definitely want to check that out to make sure that you have that on your radar when things get deprecated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, I always make sure that I check that because you can&#8217;t have deprecated machines, especially in client sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And when they&#8217;re announced through the console&#8230; So, sometimes clients tell me, &#8220;Okay, I get this yellow&#8230; What does it mean?&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have to ignore it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>It&#8217;s for styling. Just ignore it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>And then, there is a post about the interactivity API best practices by Felix Arntz, and also, Avoiding Deprecation Warnings is part of the headlines there. But definitely, if you are working with the interactivity API, definitely check it out. It gives you quite a few interesting pointers there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, there is a more efficient block-type registration. This is also from Felix, yes. Now, you can register multiple blocks in one function so it doesn&#8217;t have to be called over and over again, which is definitely a performance improvement, and also, you don&#8217;t have so much code in it then. Check that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, I&#8217;ll check that out, because I&#8217;ve added in another custom function that allows us to do that just in one function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> You don&#8217;t have to call it out multiple times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, right, yeah. So, anything in the WordPress 6.8 that you wanted to talk about that we skipped here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Definitely, the new filter, because that&#8217;s going to be…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, the Should Load Block Asset on Demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> On Demand, yes&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, explain that to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah. So, with that new filter, it really just allows developers to make sure that blocks will only load their assets, the styling, and the scripts for that block when it&#8217;s actually on a page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> When it&#8217;s used on a page. So, that was available for core blocks before. Let me just&#8230; There&#8217;s one other filter, I think, that is part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Should Load Separate Core Blocks</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Should Load Separate Core Block Assets, that one we are using on BT, just handled differently. Again, custom function because we do have custom blocks that I would want to not load, because by default, that loads, right? So, with BT, that only loads when it&#8217;s actually used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would have to change to this new filter because this one is more efficient. It just does it out of the box. So, with Should Load Separate Core Block Assets, it does two things, it loads the core blocks, and then, with the Total Block library script, with all of the styling and stuff, and then, the scripts and the style sheet for that particular block, what this new filter does is, it loads, yeah, I mentioned that, it only loads the script and the styles for that block, not the entire thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, like…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> So, that&#8217;s going to be a lot of improvement. We do that already, which means I have to change that function to this new filter, which is amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. You were definitely ahead of your time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Because we need to fix things when WordPress is not yet ready to fix it because we need that function right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> We can&#8217;t just wait. But glad that what we&#8217;ve done for BT is being done by default now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you can rip it out. All right, my dears, dear listeners, we are all through the 6.8 release so far, and I hope you find some really good things in there. Now, we&#8217;re coming to Gutenberg 20.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 20.5</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And don&#8217;t be alarmed, and we have 20.6, but there are not a whole lot of new things or mentionable enhancements that we want to mention here. So, we&#8217;ll still, probably, stay within the time of our podcast, although there is no time. It takes as long as it takes, like many other things in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Because there&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So, 20.5 Gutenberg Plugin, it has the updated edit site link for the admin bar that now goes, actually, back to the site editor and not to the page that you were actually on or the template that you were on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that confused a lot of people because every time you clicked on it, you were on a different page. So, sure, every time you click on it, to go to the same page. So, that is really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Create Block Package now supports blocks manifests and the relevant core APIs by default. That needed a little bit of bug fix in there, but that is now&#8230; It also has to do with the multiple blocks, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> So, this one, I think, is a huge deal because having it aligned better with core and the support manifests by default means there&#8217;s less guesswork and just better starting point for custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes. Yeah, absolutely, yeah. So, the Block button, if it&#8217;s used in the navigation bar, now also has&#8230; So, when you&#8217;re in a navigation bar and you add another link, if it&#8217;s a custom page link, it offers you creating a new page, but not with a button. So, now, when you add a button to it, also gives you the capability to draft a new page, which is really nice. So, you can use those buttons more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What else is in there? So, the Data View Actions, as a plugin developer, you can use a modal to do whatever the action is. And now, you also have the possibility that you can control the size of the modal so it&#8217;s not the same size every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you have a lot of white space there, or you can focus on certain things. Now, you can actually control the size through props. That&#8217;s developer speak, but you will appreciate that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Of course. There are a couple of updates there that make me smile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Which one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> The Trailing Period Cleanup and the Defaulting Back To, the 100 PX Spacer Block default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> These are really just petty things for me, but I&#8217;m glad that people find them weird as well. So, they&#8217;re fixing it and adding it back, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Good, yeah. So, there&#8217;s a change in the Data Views, which comes on par with the WPA, the old page things where you have the pages listed in the admin as a sub-page if you have sub-pages like&#8230; So, hierarchical kind of dimension there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah, hierarchical and not a flat thing. And that helps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And that now came, also, to the Data Views. So, you have a cluster, the way you actually designed it or put them together. So, I&#8217;m sorry, there&#8217;s a little&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> I&#8217;m also reading through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I need to read through that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Oh, the mobile one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> So, when I test VT, I always test on multiple interfaces, like you should, and that also includes editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, yeah, editing on mobile, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Editing on mobile is a lot easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Oh, now, yeah. That&#8217;s good, yeah. What else do we have? That&#8217;s pretty much for 20.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. There&#8217;s also the documentation about the WP scripts with the build blocks manifest has been updated as well. So, you can read up about it. And the Color Experimental Duotone has been removed from core blocks, but I hope they&#8217;ll keep it in. That is stabilized now. So, it&#8217;s called Filter Duotone instead of Color Experimental Duotone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s just a rewording of things, and also, to make it stable so people are more inclined to use it in their custom blocks as well, because some people shy away from experimental stuff because they don&#8217;t know how it will turn out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Usually, they change their name, which is going to be the case here. I don&#8217;t think we have&#8230; So, for our client projects, we usually do shy away from the experimental stuff just so&#8230; It needs to be as stable as it should be-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, that makes total sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>&#8230; in my personal projects still, yeah. I do use that in my&#8230; Well, I play around with all of the experimental stuff on my own theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, it&#8217;s fun, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> You end up seeing all the things that get broken on the next update, which is fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Or you at least can start prognosis, like, &#8220;Which one gets broken first,&#8221; kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Makes begging easier. So, that was Gutenberg 20.5.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 20.6</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are now coming to Gutenberg 20.6, and there are additional features in there that are not coming to 6.8, except for the Enabling the Startup Pattern for all post types. That was back-ported to 6.8, but the others are&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think that the keyboard shortcut to paste styles is actually in 6.8. I think that&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin, and it doesn&#8217;t have the, yeah, it does not come to 6.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> That&#8217;s sad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s sad. Oh, so sad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> I liked that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, they&#8217;re adding support for more granular controls for the Table of Content block, which also hasn&#8217;t made it to Core yet because it needs a little bit more finessing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But if you use it in your private sites, or while some people, like me, are brave or are stupid, depending on the perspective, they use Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> They use it on…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, Gutenberg production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JC Palmes: Yes. But this Table of Content block controls things that I love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> But again, it&#8217;s one of those almost-there blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. And what we are talking about right now is that you can select the heading levels. So, if you want all the H2s in there, then you can say that, oh, you want all H1 to H2 to H6 in there, you can say that too, or anything in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s a nice setting on the sidebar for the Table of Content. And I think I tweeted out a little video to show that off, but&#8230; When I was testing it, I said, &#8220;Oh, this is nice.&#8221; Yeah. Then, whereas the navigation bar has…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Navigation, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; it gets a transparency slider for the sub-menus background, which is highly appreciated. But also, that is not yet in. It just came in in 20.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes:</em> Just began in 6.8 too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, that is out. So, 6.8, just so, if you want to go back and look at things, 6.8 has Gutenberg plugins from 19.4 to 20.4. So, with 2020. And most of the time, only bug fixes get back-ported to the current version, but then, new enhancements are not going to make it there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 20.6 Gutenberg Plugin, you also get a new option for opening the links in a new tab for the RSS block. And that is something that a lot of people wanted, and now, we have it. Now you can shortcut for pasting styles. Was that the 20.6 already?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>JC Palmes: </em>Yeah, that&#8217;s the 20.6&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it was a small release because most of the Gutenberg developers like George Mamadashvili, Fabian Kägy, Akiyama Anu, and a few others, they were all really, in the release cycle, occupied with that. So, yes. But that&#8217;s it. We are almost at the end of our show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, thank you, dear listeners, and thank you, JC, for sticking it out with me and having a discussion on that.

The slower pace of Gutenberg development is a blessing in disguise. I will take the opportunity to dive deeper into block themes, styles, block and section styles, and block development. I definitely also see a need to skill up my CSS. What is it that you need to learn?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds funny coming from me, as I&#8217;ve been knee-deep in Gutenberg development all this time. Still, if I don&#8217;t actually practice the skills I acquired, I lose them. That&#8217;s why I decided to tackle the migration of the Gutenberg Times website to a block theme.

This method lets developers change the layout, design, and functionality using filters or hooks. Developers can make changes by focusing on specific parts like the product image, description, price, and currency. This approach avoids disrupting other sections of the page. This strategy keeps code clean and ensures functionality.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case what the WordPress Playground is, and how it&#8217;s transforming the scope of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you or your idea featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Birgit Pauli-Haack. Birgit is a longtime WordPress user, an influential voice in the WordPress community. She&#8217;s known for her role as the curator at the Gutenberg Times, and host of the Gutenberg Changelog podcast, and she brings her wealth of experience as a Core contributor to WordPress as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She joins me today for an in-person conversation recorded at WordCamp Asia in the Philippines, and we are discussing Playground, a remarkable development that&#8217;s set to redefine the WordPress development landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playground allows users to launch a fully functional WordPress instance directly in their browser, without the necessity of a server, database, or PHP, playground breaks down barriers, offering developers, product owners, educators, and everyone in between a new way to interact with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore how this technology not only simplifies the testing and development process, but also sets the stage for more interactive and immediate web experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore the concept of Blueprints within Playground, tailored configurations that enables a bespoke user experience by preloading plugins, themes, and content. This feature helps developers to present their work in a controlled environment, offering users an insightful hands-on approach that can significantly enhance understanding and engagement, and it&#8217;s all available with just one click. It really does eliminate the traditional hurdles associated with installing WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how the WordPress Playground is set to usher in a new era of friction free web development, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Birgit Pauli-Haack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Birgit Pauli-Haack. Hello Birgit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:28] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Oh, hey Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re actually looking at each other, not through a screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yes. It&#8217;s a total different feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Birgit And I chat a lot on various other channels, and it&#8217;s a pleasure having you right in front of me. That&#8217;s lovely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:39] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yeah, same here. I&#8217;m always glad we meet at a WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, thank you. So that&#8217;s the introduction then because here we are, we&#8217;re at WordCamp Asia, in the Philippines. It&#8217;s the first day of the conference in general. We had the Contributor Day yesterday, and we&#8217;ve got another day tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re going to have a chat with Birgit who is going to be talking to us today about Playground, because you&#8217;ve got a slot at the event all about creating a demo in Playground. And we&#8217;ll get onto that in a minute. But first of all, for those people who don&#8217;t know who you are, just a few moments for your potted bio. Tell us about yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> So I&#8217;m the curator at the Gutenberg Times and I&#8217;m the host on the Gutenberg Changelog podcast. And I also am a Core contributor to WordPress, and I work for Automattic. I live in Munich and I&#8217;m married, 37 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There we go. That is a very potted bio. Thank you, I appreciate that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we are, we&#8217;re going to talk about Playground. And I figured the best place to start is answering the question, what is Playground? And just before we hit record, it was pretty obvious that both you and I are very excited about this. And so I want to encourage people to really pay attention because this genuinely, for me is one of the most exciting developments, not just now, but ever, in WordPress. It truly is a transformational technology. But for those who don&#8217;t know what it is, just tell us what Playground is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:54] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> I&#8217;m totally with you there on the magic, yeah. And it&#8217;s not just for WordPress, it&#8217;s for web development. So WordPress Playground is a WordPress instance in your browser. Yeah, you go there, put in playground.wordpress.net. You get a full WordPress instance in your browser, and you can add plugins, you can themes, you can content. Test it out. Whatever you do with that and want to learn with Playgrounds, you don&#8217;t need a server, you don&#8217;t need a database, you don&#8217;t need PHP installed or something like that. So it&#8217;s just there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for someone who has been in the web development for many, many years, it&#8217;s like magic. Because before you&#8217;re always kind of, oh, where do I host things? What&#8217;s with the database? What&#8217;s with the server? And it&#8217;s all gone. Yeah, so it&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think probably it&#8217;s best on this particular podcast to avoid the technicalities, but I would point the listener to a podcast that I did on the WP Tavern with Adam Zielinski several months ago now, where Adam came on and tried, in an audio form, it&#8217;s very hard to do, but explained in an audio form exactly what the underpinnings are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the only words I can use to describe it are, it&#8217;s voodoo. It is literal magic. Just two or three years ago, if you&#8217;d have said that Playground was possible, I honestly would&#8217;ve thought that you were talking nonsense. It could not happen. That will never happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:18] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Snake oil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, exactly. And yet Adam managed to pull it off. And so just to re-explain what Birgit just said, it&#8217;s all in the browser. When you go to playground.wordpress.net, there is no server. Just say it again, there&#8217;s no server. There&#8217;s no PHP that you need to install on your local machine. It all happens inside the browser. Close the browser down, it goes away. We&#8217;ll come to that. Maybe that&#8217;s changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the idea is it&#8217;s happening in the browser, and so you can have any combination of website that you like immediately inside of Playground, and it really is remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I liken to the moment that the iPhone got the App Store. The iPhone was a very useful thing to have. You know, it did phone calls and it looked beautiful, and you could upload music to the phone with a cable. And then along came the App Store, and suddenly a thousand, a million, different developers could get their hands on it and tell you, here&#8217;s a different way you can use the iPhone. And here&#8217;s another way, and here&#8217;s another thing that you can do. And it feels a bit like Playground is WordPress&#8217; moment like that. You know, it just suddenly prizes the lid open, and makes developers able to show you what they&#8217;ve got in a heartbeat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:25] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yeah. And that&#8217;s pretty much, that&#8217;s a very good analogy because we also have a Blueprints gallery that could be something like an app store where you can learn how you can assemble it. So the core technologies is not not, I don&#8217;t know any of the technology that&#8217;s underlying. It&#8217;s based on Web Assembly. And that has been around for about 10 years, trying to get a lot of different programming languages talk to each other in the browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it&#8217;s based, not on MySQL, but on SQLite database. And then Service Workers and worker Threads API, that are browser APIs. For storage, for instance, yeah, or for sending commands to other different applications. But that&#8217;s all I know, yeah. I have never worked with Web Assembly, yeah. And MySQL, I know that, just really amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can use that. Many people use it to spin up a fully functional WordPress and demo that. So you can use it in educational settings. You don&#8217;t have to download a whole lot of stuff. You don&#8217;t have to, as a teacher, you don&#8217;t have to set up, talk to your IT department to set up a server for all the students. You can just point them to the Playground and then give them instructions on how to work with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a sandbox environment. It could be, yeah, if you want to. You can upload your content and then see what else can you change with it without messing with your live site. You can integrate it with your development. There is a WP now, VS Code extension where you can, so when you&#8217;re working on your plugin and you click on the button, it loads up a local Playground for you with the plugin that you&#8217;re working on already installed, and that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same with the theme. The training team has been working on interactive demos in terms of having code examples on one side, and then you make changes to the code and you see it in the right hand side. How it changes the website. So that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think one of the things that you said there, you&#8217;ve got an understanding of some of the underlying technologies, but you were stressing that, basically you don&#8217;t need to understand them. Having a knowledge of them is fun, you know, it&#8217;s interesting. But a bit like I don&#8217;t have the faintest idea how to build an iPhone app, but I can still use an iPhone. And I can still benefit from this application, the maps, navigation app. I don&#8217;t need to understand how that&#8217;s built, but I can use it, it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And really that&#8217;s, I think the purpose. The developers over there, thank you so much, but most people are never probably going to want to get into the weeds of that. They just want to click the button and see what happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just to be clear on this, if you&#8217;ve never done that, I, at my home, have a fairly good internet connection, so I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m in a sort of slightly privileged position, but when I click the button at playground.wordpress.net, I&#8217;m imagining it&#8217;s somewhere in the order of three to four seconds before that website is ready to go. Basically it&#8217;s the length of time it takes me to blink and grab the mouse again. It&#8217;s in a heartbeat. So there&#8217;s literally no friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you go to playground.wordpress.net and click the button, what you&#8217;re going to get there is a vanilla version of WordPress, which is fine. Then you can do whatever you like with that, put plugins in, what have you. But wouldn&#8217;t it be interesting, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if somebody came up with, oh, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s call them Blueprints or something like that, where you could pre-build something that then somebody else could use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is the App Store, isn&#8217;t it? You know, somebody&#8217;s built the maps navigation app. Somebody&#8217;s built the note taking app. Somebody&#8217;s built the whatever. This feels like what the Blueprints are. But I want to make sure that you are describing it and not me because I am not sure that I&#8217;ve encapsulated it perfectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:00] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> No, you did. But in opposite to the App Store, you actually can look at other people&#8217;s Blueprints and steal them. Blueprints are written in JSON has nothing to do with Jason. It&#8217;s JSON. It&#8217;s a data format for JavaScript. And there is a schema for it, so when you put it into your code editor, it gives you signals, yeah, that you formatted right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have two different ways of configuring your Playground instance. One is to do settings. So you could do which PHP you want to use? Which WordPress version do you want to use? Also, do you want to have network enabled? And most of the time you want it enabled because you want to import and install themes or something like that. Those are the settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have steps. And those steps are also just formulated in JSON format. For instance, you can log in. Automatically log in the person in the Playground. Or you can say, I have a landing page that should land, so when somebody uses that blueprint, when Playground is ready to completely load it, you should land in the block editor, for instance. And you should have that particular block plugin already active on that post, so you can really play with blocks. Nick Diego with his plugin Block Visibility has done a great way for a live preview of his block from the repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way is to, so install a plugin, add content to it. Use WP-CLI to instantly load up new versions, add new pictures, or use an export from another website, an XML file from another website and load it into the Playground instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sometimes you have, you said you get the vanilla if you just do that, if you just do playground.wordpress.net, you get the vanilla WordPress. But it&#8217;s one post, Hello World, and it&#8217;s one sample page. But you don&#8217;t see how content kind of interacts with whatever feature you want to demo. So you need some content there, yeah. And the Blueprints Gallery has actually some nice examples on how to configure that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s come back to the gallery in a minute. Just to recap what you just said. So there&#8217;s a bunch of settings, probably more for developers. You know, you might want to test something in a particular PHP environment or what have you, so you can select those. And then you can do these steps where you can essentially design, if somebody was to use that Playground and somebody was to click on your link, they would wait the 2, 3, 4 seconds, whatever, and then, depending on the steps that you&#8217;d set up, they would arrive where you chose them to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, you might pre-install the latest, greatest plugin that you want to share with the world. And you want people in a post for that. And you want them inside the block editor. And you can make it so that upon clicking the button, the first thing they get is, we&#8217;re inside your plugin, we&#8217;re about to use it. So the profundity of that is pretty amazing. You can really tailor the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So rather than going from being like Playground, which sounds like children, you&#8217;re messing about, larking about a little bit. It also becomes like serious ground a little bit, you know? Serious developers can use this to circumvent, I don&#8217;t know, support tickets, the capacity to demonstrate to users who&#8217;ve never seen your product before, your plugin, your theme, or whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can point them to a link. They can click the link. You as the developer configure everything within an inch of its life, so they get exactly where you want them to be. And in that way you can use it as a sales mechanism, as a support mechanism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:29] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> And sometimes it&#8217;s really hard to tell people what your plugin does unless you show it them in the video. But then they still don&#8217;t get their hands on it. And with that feature, with the Playground combined with the Blueprints, you can actually make them feel the thing. How it works with them, and what ideas they get when they play around with it, and have better questions, educated questions for you, for the product, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So a Blueprint then is a version of Playground in which somebody has pre-configured things. Is that basically what it is? You know, let&#8217;s say that I have got this fabulous new plugin and I want you to experience it. I don&#8217;t necessarily want you to land on a particular page, but I just want the plugin to be available to you and you can do things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I install my plugin, use Playground to do that, I can then share a link. And because I&#8217;ve tinkered with it, it becomes a Blueprint because it&#8217;s not the playground.wordpress.net version, it&#8217;s my doctored version, adapted version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:26] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Well, it also goes to playground.wordpress.net, but it has a query parameter, to be a little technical term, that says, use the blueprint at this URL. So a plugin developer for the repository, at the repository there are live preview buttons now. And the plugin developer can put in a separate directory Blueprints on the WordPress site, put all the assets, all the image that they want to load, and the configuration file, which is written in this JSON file, and put it there, and then make that live. And every time someone clicks on the preview button, they go to playground.wordpress.net with the Blueprint kind of loaded, the configuration files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s all happening through playground.wordpress.net. But then there&#8217;s JSON configuration file, which gets sort of sideloaded, if you like, through the URL. That tells it, okay, add this and then end up here and what have you. The important part is that JSON, that&#8217;s what makes it the Blueprint. It&#8217;s going to playground.wordpress.net, but the JSON file means that it does something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you said the word gallery, which tells me that there&#8217;s a whole host of these things. Pre-configured, pre-built, put into a box if you like. And we can go to that gallery and explore. What kind of stuff is in there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:38] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> So, what kind of stuff is there? So there&#8217;s one, how do I put an admin notice on top of the dashboard? How do I add a dashboard widget and load it up with my Playground? So most of the time, when you want to log into a WordPress site, you get the dashboard. And if there&#8217;s a widget, you can actually guide people to go some other places. You can say, okay, I have a plugin that needs 50 posts, for whatever reason. So there is a Blueprint there and how to use WP-CLI to create 12 or 50 posts automatically, that are then loaded into the post content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s also a Blueprint for a specific WooCommerce extension. So it loads WooCommerce, it loads the extension, it loads some products, and then you land for a shipping page where you can say, okay, this shipping plugin, what does it do for me? And you see it working with products on a Playground site. So that is really remarkable. It takes a little longer when you have content to load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Goes up to like 10 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:40] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> So you go and get your coffee and come back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But it&#8217;s still profound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:43] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yeah, remarkable. Yeah, you don&#8217;t have to do anything, kind of just wait a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What else is in there? Oh, there is a demo of 2025. So when you load 2025 theme automatically and go to your website and see it, you get the post, the blog site, where all the posts are in one one big site with the full content. And not a whole lot of people have that kind of blog. And in the demo, you actually go to the magazine front page, and then see all the patterns that are in there. You can see all the templates in that Playground demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s interesting for plugin developers that have experimental themes or experimental settings on the settings page that you can actually preload them as well. There&#8217;s an example in there for the Gutenberg experiments. They&#8217;re on the check marks on a setting site. And you can take that and replicate that for your own plugins site, how to do that, with the areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you can do site options. So the site options is not only site title and tag descriptions, also, oh, make my block editor have the top toolbar instead of all the other things or the distraction free model, yeah. So these kind of features, you can also preload there and have examples from the Blueprints Gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think we&#8217;re just at the beginning really, aren&#8217;t we? Of of this journey. And basically, the underlying technology is now provisioned. It&#8217;s there. And we&#8217;re at point where, okay, people, developers, explore. And we&#8217;re really just at the beginning of that. And the gallery is probably a good place to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you wanted to put one of these JSON files together, do you know, is there some credible documentation out there that would help people to get started, learn the ropes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:25] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s definitely, there&#8217;s documentation of all the steps that are there, yeah, like how to run PHP, how to have additional PHP extensions installed and all that. So when you open the Playground, there are three, and you&#8217;re not going to the full page, so you have three panes. On the left hand side you have some menus, and one of them is the documentation link. So that&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And another link is there, it&#8217;s the Blueprint Gallery. So in the middle of the section of your Playground, you see all the list of all the gallery content. And then when you click on the preview or the view site, the Playground loads that for you, and then there&#8217;s another menu item where is says, view Blueprint. And that gives you a Blueprint editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you see the Blueprint loaded in, but then when you want to edit from the documentation, okay, what happens when I put that in? And you click the run button, and it reloads that Playground with your changes. So it&#8217;s really, very hands on, and you still don&#8217;t have to create a server or a local environment or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s this really virtuous cycle of, okay, so you&#8217;ve used something from the gallery, but you&#8217;re curious about how it works. Look, here&#8217;s how it works. Here&#8217;s the buttons to click to go and explore. Oh, and whilst you&#8217;re at it, if you want to edit anything, here&#8217;s the option to edit it. And when you click save, it&#8217;ll restart that whole thing and you&#8217;ll get the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So all of the sort of helpful tooling is now built into it. Because when I talked to Adam, none of that existed. I mean, the version selection for PHP didn&#8217;t exist. The ability to land people on particular destinations when they first load up the playground, none of that existed. It was literally the technology of getting it working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now built into it is this knowledge base, if you like. Not really a knowledge base, but more, you want to know how this one works? We&#8217;ll show you. And it&#8217;s that beautiful, well, the purpose of WordPress, democratising publishing. In this case, it&#8217;s democratising the nuts and the bolts, and the bits and pieces of publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so that&#8217;s really nice. And that&#8217;s all built inside. So just follow the prompts in the UI, and you can adapt what you want, and what have you. But also there are some 101 articles out there, perhaps on Learn or something like that where can see in text format how do all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:40] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yeah, the developer blog has, on developer.wordpress.org/news has three articles about Playground. One is about the underlying technology from the Web Assembly people. That was really good for those who want to explore that even further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there is one on what use cases you can do with a little bit of an example. And then also, so we are right now always talking about playground.wordpress.net. But you mentioned something that someone could put this on their website, and you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playground can be self-hosted. It does not have to go through the wordpress.net site. But how to do this is in the documentation. It has a seperate section there. So if you say, okay, I don&#8217;t have my plugin in the repo, but I want to use it through my own website, then you can actually put it there, and it&#8217;ll have your own branding around it. So it&#8217;s even get further than just the WordPress part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that&#8217;s a really important distinction to make. So in the cases that we&#8217;ve been talking about so far, if you want to go to playground.wordpress.net and you use your own JSON file, it will be able to suck in anything from the WordPress repo. And that&#8217;s the sort of, the WordPress way, if you like. I&#8217;m doing air quotes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:51] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Also from GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, thank you. Yeah, that&#8217;s an important distinction. I&#8217;d forgotten that. Also from GitHub, but you know, it&#8217;s everything that&#8217;s open source out there, free to download already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a big part of the WordPress community, one of the things that makes it popular, is the ability to sell commercial plugins. And so that was another question that I had. Is possible to do it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yes, but you need to take the technology that builds WordPress at playground.wordpress.net, you put that onto your own server, and you can do whatever you like with that. So you can put your premium products in there on a, I don&#8217;t know, two day free trial sort of basis, and show people how that all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Playground suddenly becomes more interesting outside of the free to play area as well. And you can imagine that being a really, really useful tool. Because we&#8217;ve always been able to play fairly straightforwardly with free things on the repo, but suddenly the moment where you&#8217;ve got to pay $100 for a thing, the capacity to see that really is the bit which opens the wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, it&#8217;s $100, maybe I&#8217;ll buy it, maybe I won&#8217;t. It&#8217;d be nice to see it. Okay, they&#8217;ve got a 14 day trial, but I&#8217;ve still got to pay for it. This opens up the capacity to, look, there it really is. Play with it for two days or whatever it may be. That&#8217;s fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:05] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Absolutely, yeah. And if you want to test that plugin, yeah, you still would need a local server or a hosting server to load it on. And you have that 14 day trial. And now you can really test it right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right. And that&#8217;s the other big thing. Because if you buy a commercial plugin, you then have to spin up a site somehow. You have to download the plugin, upload the plugin, get the plugin configured. This gets rid of all of that, because you don&#8217;t need to download and upload anything, and it can be pre-configured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the author of the plugin can say, okay, if you want to use my LMS plugin for this kind of thing, here&#8217;s playground version with everything just right. And if you want to do it for this kind of thing, I don&#8217;t know, you&#8217;re an elementary school teacher who might use my LMS plugin in this way, or you&#8217;re a university lecturer, who might use it in this way. Let&#8217;s build it a perfect version for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can imagine that a million times over for all the commercial plugins out there. You know, form plugins. Okay, this is the contact form that we&#8217;ve pre-built. This is the, I don&#8217;t know, the form which integrates with WooCommerce or whatever. So the developers can do all of this. And that really makes it super useful to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:11] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yes, absolutely, yeah. What&#8217;s coming down the pipeline for Playground. One is that you can also use it with private GitHub repos. Which right now is not possible, but it&#8217;s in the works. And there was a problem with the proxy, that you get some cross site downloading errors because some servers are not set up to have images downloaded from a machine. They have created a proxy server now, where that is kind of circumvented that you can also from non WordPress sites download stuff, like images and content, or PHP plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What also comes is, so SQL, MySQL, for some plugins Playground does not work yet, because they use very specific MySQL query, the union query, for instance. Select union and other commands like that. The SQLite doesn&#8217;t have those yet. And they are however working on it to replicate these kind of behavior of a database also with Playground. So to make it even more compatible with all the plugins that are out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think they did a test of 10,000 plugins that are in the repo, and test every month kind of how many plugins don&#8217;t work with it yet. And they got it down from, I think 7% to 5%. So it&#8217;s always kind of progressing very well towards zero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of things going on in the background that the likes of you and I probably, you know, because we&#8217;re curious about it, we&#8217;ll probably know about, but maybe the average listener who&#8217;s not wedded to this subject maybe doesn&#8217;t. But that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the intention is to get it so that more or less anything works in more or less any scenario. And really nicely putting it out there so that you can do things which aren&#8217;t bound to GPL, WordPressy kind of things, if you know what I mean. So, you know, you can use your commercial product over here, and you can use your GitHub repo over here. That&#8217;s really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My understanding is that when Adam began it, he was immediately repurposed. So Adam Zielinski, he was an, was, still is, I think, an Automattician. And I think that it was immediately understood, this is profound. Let&#8217;s get Adam on this full time. You know, it&#8217;s no longer a hobby project. But I also think that he&#8217;s got other people from Automattic involved. There&#8217;s like a little team around it now, pushing the development of that. Is that still the case? Is this a team which is growing, or stagnating at, well not stagnating, maintaining at a certain number?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:33] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s growing in scope. So they&#8217;re also working, and that was a focus starting in last fall, that they&#8217;re working on using Playground for the Data Liberation Project. And that&#8217;s what Adam was doing also full-time now in the last few months. That he looks, okay, what kind of parser do we need to do really good data liberation from other systems, or from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, because the import and export in WordPress only gets you so far, yeah. And there are some quirks in there, and they want to really have a perfect data liberation through Playground. They have a browser extension. It&#8217;s all beta right now. It&#8217;s not functioning yet. But it&#8217;s really coming along quite nicely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So Data Liberation then is this very laudable project of being able to bring into WordPress, I guess data liberation on some levels is the whole point of open source really, isn&#8217;t it? Is that you can grab your data and just pick it up and take it somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:34] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Open content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right, yeah. It&#8217;s your content. This platform is no longer being used, or you&#8217;ve fallen out with it. You know, you no longer love it in the way that you did. You want to now move it here. And you&#8217;ll be able to, let&#8217;s say, go Joomla into WordPress, Drupal into WordPress, or as you said, WordPress into WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which suddenly kind of opens up the whole idea of migrating websites, which a real mess frankly. It&#8217;s a really difficult thing to do. And I often think that people are bound to products and services that they&#8217;re purchasing on a monthly basis because the migration process is so difficult. And they don&#8217;t want to be caught up in all of that because things can go wrong. You know, it might not work perfectly and there&#8217;s all the just carrying it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you can essentially do migrations, and Playground is the sort of go between. It&#8217;s the bit which talks from, I don&#8217;t know, one hosting company to another. So it goes from hosting company A to Playground. Playground then serves it up to hosting company B, which is where you want to end up. And all of that happens through Playground. That&#8217;s remarkable. And you can do the inspecting in the middle bit, the middleware, Playground if you like. Check it&#8217;s all working before you deploy it. That&#8217;s amazingly powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:41] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yeah. And that&#8217;s actually the vision of Playground&#8217;s part of Data Liberation. They also have a browser extension to kind of identify a non WordPress site, the various pieces like the pages, the posts, the news, the events, kind of the custom post types. And then kind of teach Playground what it all is. But that&#8217;s kind of, it&#8217;s very technical on one side, but it&#8217;s also, you need to have a total different concept about content management systems to actually make that. So that&#8217;s not really for a normal consumer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, because if you&#8217;re coming from Drupal and you&#8217;ve got like 1,000 different modules in there, you know, think plugins in the WordPress space. Then it&#8217;s going to be difficult to one-to-one map that over to WordPress. But the endeavor is to do a half decent job and in the middle you can step in and say, okay, this might need modifying, that might need modifying. And then you can go back to your Drupal install, change things a little bit, try again because it takes no time to do it. That is really a key, interesting part. You do kind of wonder actually if hosting companies in the future will just offer Playground in as part of their bundle, you know, their onboarding migrating bundle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:47] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yeah. A lot of hosting companies have their own plugins for that. So I know that Pressable and SpinupWP, they all have their, or wordpress.com has their own plugin that they then connect with. I think it&#8217;s BlogVault most of the time. Pantheon, same, yeah. Where you can migrate in. But that part in the middle, that kind of always takes a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you are bound to the hosting company to actually offer that, yeah. And that&#8217;s not a cheap plugin. But if you go from one small hosting to one, another small hosting, you don&#8217;t have that luxury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, and if you&#8217;re crossing platforms as well, say Joomla into WordPress and what have you. That&#8217;s also really different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:25] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yeah. There are a few agencies who have built for their customer things, but it&#8217;s not open source and it&#8217;s, well, it&#8217;s open source, but it&#8217;s not meant for a huge amount of public to kind of use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;d imagine that it&#8217;s fairly proprietary technology, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s probably locked down because it&#8217;s the secret source of getting the Drupal installs into WordPress on their platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things which Adam spoke about when we talked, I don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;re at with this, but I raised the question of the destructibility of it. So essentially when I spoke to Adam, when you launched Playground, you fiddle with it, played with it, the moment you click close on the browser tab everything went away. That&#8217;s how it was designed. But he said that at some point in the near future, and maybe that moment has already been passed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:09] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> It&#8217;s here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so now we&#8217;ve got a more permanent version. Tell us about that. Are there any constraints on that? Like, can I close the browser tab? Can I shut my computer down, for example? I mean, will it last forever? Could I even use it as a, I don&#8217;t know, as a temporary website in, let&#8217;s say I work in a school and I want an intranet for my staff or something, could for those kind of things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:29] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Well, it cannot be, it doesn&#8217;t have a domain or something like that. So that wouldn&#8217;t work. But yes, you can save. You have two options to save the site that you&#8217;re working on, so you can come back tomorrow. One is in the browser. So it uses the local storage of the browser and really downloads the whole WordPress stuff there. And then you open up the browser again, you get the site again. You cannot load it from another computer because it&#8217;s a different browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second option is to load it in your local file system. So you can, it downloads the whole thing, gives you a directory and that&#8217;s your website, and you can load it then back into Playground a day later, or a week later, or two months later, because it&#8217;s still on your computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also have multiple sites now in one Playground instance. So you can say, okay, save this site, and then now I use another blueprint, load it again and it&#8217;s another temporary site. And you load it, you save it again, then you have a second website there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> A curious version of version control or something like that. You&#8217;ve added this plugin in, I&#8217;m going to save a new version marking that this plugin got added. Let&#8217;s see how that works. And then if it doesn&#8217;t work, we can roll back to the, just delete that one and go back to the previous one. Oh gosh. So essentially permanent. Locally permanent maybe is the better way to describe it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:50] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> And you need to think about the saving part. If you do a second site and you close it, a browser without the saving part, it&#8217;s going to go away. Yeah, it&#8217;s still ephemeral there. Which is also a good thing sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But obviously as you said, you know, the point of hosting in the end is that, you know, it connects to a domain name, it goes through the DNS process and you you can see it online. No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:10] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> No, not yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This is not. Oh, not yet. I wonder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:12] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> No, no, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s ever going to be. But what can be, soon hopefully is kind of pushing it to a hosting company. And that, I think it needs to be just finalised which hosting is going to be there. And the Playground team learns a lot from wordpress.com, because the new development, local development system that wordpress.com has, Studio, is based on Playground. They develop some of the features also for, that wordpress.com can use them in their Studio. And what was the bug fixes? Come to Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That makes real sense though, for hosting companies to be clamoring all over this, to build a Playground import functionality. Because then developers all over the world, you know, maybe if in teams it might be a little bit more difficult, but you know, a solo developer, certainly at the moment, you&#8217;ve been working on something. You&#8217;ve got this perfect version of the site, you&#8217;ve got all the plugins that you want, you&#8217;ve set it up, it&#8217;s working on my machine. Now I go over to my hosting company of choice, click the import Playground button and there it is. Why wouldn&#8217;t the hosting companies offer that frankly, it just seems too straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:17] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Syncing up with the live site or there&#8217;s also a GitHub deployment there. It opens so many ideas, yeah. And when you ask Adam, well, if I think about this, and can you do that? He said, sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Give a few weeks. I&#8217;ll add it to list of 1,000 things that people have already suggested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:32] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yeah, we need to develop that. Yeah, the ideas are there, the prototypes are there, the proof of concept is already done. Just a matter of resources now, yeah. I can for instance see one thing is, if you have a documentation and you need people to contribute to documentation, you load the documentation in Playground, you make the changes, and then you push it to GitHub as a pull request. And then somebody can review it, load it in their own Playground and approve it so the documentation could be updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something like that is already in use. That scenario, that&#8217;s in prototype. It&#8217;s not there yet, but we know that it can work, because some theme developers have that process. They&#8217;re not developers per se, that they go into the files. They load the theme into Playground, use the Create Block Theme plugin. Make the changes to the theme. Save it and create the block theme, so it&#8217;s in files. Then push it to GitHub as a pull request for this theme, and then have all the changes there. So that&#8217;s how a lot of designers work with their developers on the themes. They don&#8217;t have to touch any code, but it&#8217;s still all saved in code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s just such an interesting beginning of everything. It does feel like we are at a moment where there&#8217;s just so many different roads that could be taken, and lots of people coming up with lots of different ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just quickly circling back to the Studio thing that you mentioned. So Studio is a local development environment. You&#8217;re going to be downloading this as a software bundle for your Mac or your Windows machine or what have you. You&#8217;re saying that&#8217;s a wrapper for Playground, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:13] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But that&#8217;s immutably stored. That&#8217;s not dependent on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:17] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> No, it&#8217;s on your machine, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right. So it&#8217;s going for the files on the machine approach as opposed to being stored in the browser. So if you download and make use of Studio, you can close that machine down, come back to it whenever you like, it&#8217;s there until you decide to delete it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:32] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Like any other local environment that you can, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, okay. And that&#8217;s available free you to download for anybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:38] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Free, open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. Is there anything else you wanted to cover off, apart from the fact that we&#8217;ve both got ridiculously excited about this. Was there anything curious, interesting, quirky, novel that you&#8217;ve seen out there that we haven&#8217;t yet touched?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:50] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> No, not yet. But I&#8217;m starting now to kind of dream about it. And sooner or later I come up with something, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I would want and what I want to pursue is that I can have a Playground instance for writers. And I know writers who are not very keen on using the Block Editor, because it gets in the way. But the Block Editor has these settings where you can do distraction free, where you can do, put the toolbar on top, yeah, and hide it as long as I write, and just let me have when I&#8217;m not writing kind of thing, and log in and not have to go to the menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, if I&#8217;m a blogger, I have to log into WordPress, and then I need to look at post, new post. This would give you, start writing, and don&#8217;t have to worry about the rest of it. And then click a button and then your WordPress site is updated with it. That&#8217;s kind of what I&#8217;m working on. I don&#8217;t know if really helpful, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No, that&#8217;s really great. I mean, one of the things that I always thought was curious about it would be the idea in education, for educators literally standing in front of pupils, children who, you know, depending on what the kind of curriculum they&#8217;ve got. It might be we&#8217;re doing about poetry. We want everybody to upload and modify a poem, or comment on a poem or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s the link. You know, we&#8217;re in an environment where everybody&#8217;s, we&#8217;re in the computer lab, everybody&#8217;s got a computer. Just click on this link, scan the QR code, whatever it may be. Give us your modifications, what have you. And I know that&#8217;s a sort strange example, but it&#8217;s the fact that instantly, very, very inexperienced users are in the same exact interface as all the other experienced users. And the level of difficulty was clicking a link. You just needed to click a link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the educator didn&#8217;t need a great deal of technology to set it up. The pupils needed zero technology to access it. And so it&#8217;s that one to many thing, where lots and lots of people can access the same thing in a heartbeat. And I&#8217;m imagining that the tooling to create the Playground installs, and to create the Blueprints is going to make it more and more easy in the future. So possibly not the perfect example, but I do like the example of one to many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:56] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yeah. What I like about it is that it&#8217;s not about WordPress. It&#8217;s about poetry. It&#8217;s about writing. It&#8217;s about, well, even image uploading and editing, yeah. You could certainly do that. Technology gets out of the way. And for the last 25 years, that&#8217;s always been in the way, yeah, and now it&#8217;s out of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, because the internet is basically a reading experience. I mean, I know we&#8217;ve got forms, but really all you&#8217;re doing is submitting a form so that somebody can read that. But you go to any website and largely websites, you know, if you&#8217;re going to some sort of SaaS app, that&#8217;s a different thing, it&#8217;s configured probably to be more interactive. But broadly speaking, you&#8217;re going to consume information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in this, you click a link and you&#8217;re reading information, but then you can do things with it. Oh, I think it would be better if there was an image there in that poem. Or, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s an explanation of some principle of physics or something, and a diagram would be really useful at this point, and I don&#8217;t like the way they describe that, that could go in bold. And you are interacting with the internet. And it&#8217;s totally free, and it will be easy to deploy, and it&#8217;ll take seconds to load. And all of a sudden the internet became more interactive. And it&#8217;s just the beginning. It&#8217;s very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:05] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Yeah, it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Birgit Pauli-Haack, thank you very much for talking to me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:09] <strong>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</strong> Thank you for leading me down the road of all the ideas here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you for explaining it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bph/\">Birgit Pauli-Haack</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit is a long time WordPress user, an influential voice in the WordPress community. She’s known for her role as the curator at the Gutenberg Times and host of the Gutenberg Changelog podcast. And brings her wealth of experience as a Core contributor to WordPress as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She joins me today for an in-person conversation, recorded at WordCamp Asia in the Philippines, and we’re discussing Playground, a remarkable development that&#8217;s set to redefine the WordPress development landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playground allows users to launch a fully functional WordPress instance directly in their browser. Without the necessity of a server, database, or PHP, Playground breaks down barriers, offering developers, product owners, educators and everyone in between a new way to interact with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore how this technology not only simplifies the testing and development process, but also sets the stage for more interactive and immediate web experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore the concept of Blueprints within Playground, tailored configurations that enable a bespoke user experience by preloading plugins, themes, and content. This feature helps developers to present their work in a controlled environment, offering users an insightful hands-on approach that can significantly enhance understanding and engagement, and it’s all available with just one click. It really does eliminate the traditional hurdles associated with installing WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about how the WordPress Playground is set to usher in a new era of friction-free web development, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/\"> Gutenberg Times</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/podcast/gutenberg-changelog/\">Gutenberg Changelog podcast</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Podcast with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/122-adam-zielinski-on-how-playground-is-transforming-wordpress-website-creation\">Adam Zielinski on How Playground Is Transforming WordPress Website Creation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/\"> WordPress Playground</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-visibility/\"> Block Visibility plugin</a> by Nick Diego</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2024/05/15/the-blueprint-gallery-share-your-wordpress-creations-with-playground/\">Playground  Blueprints Gallery</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/\">WordPress Developer Blog > News</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\"> Data Liberation Project</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://spinupwp.com/\"> SpinupWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blogvault.net/\"> BlogVault</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pantheon.io/\"> Pantheon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/\">WordPress  Studio</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/\"> Create Block Theme plugin</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"Do The Woo Community: The Web Agency Summit 2025 with Andrew Palmer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=93794\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://dothewoo.io/the-web-agency-summit-2025-with-andrew-palmer/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:195:\"The Web Agency Summit is a free event from April 7-11, 2025, focusing on web development, offering insights into AI, SEO, and networking opportunities for professionals across platforms and CMSs.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 10:22:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Do The Woo Community: When It’s Time to Let Go of Your Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://dothewoo.io/?post_type=blog&p=93347\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/when-its-time-to-let-go-of-your-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:198:\"Podcasting can be challenging, requiring time and effort.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, the efficacy of website usability testing for WordPress projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I bring you the first in a mini series of podcasts I recorded in person at WordCamp Asia in Manila. This flagship WordPress event brought together hundreds of WordPress professionals, enthusiasts, and all manner of interested parties under one roof for a three day event. One contributor day, and two days of presentations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tracked down several of the speakers and workshop organizers and recorded them speaking about the subject they were presenting upon. I hope that you enjoy what they had to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have the first of those conversations, and it&#8217;s with Jo Minney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jo based in Perth, Australia, is passionate about user experience, data-driven decision making, cats, pockets, and travel. She&#8217;s a small business founder, and works with organizations creating digital platforms with WordPress. She also freelances as a UX consultant. She volunteers with Mission Digital to address social issues using technology, and is an ambassador for She Codes Australia, promoting tech accessibility for women. Recognized as a 2023 Shining Star by Women in Technology, Western Australia, Jo is an international speaker on topics like user experience, accessibility, and gender equality. She&#8217;s committed to ensuring a seamless user experience, and today shares her insights from practical, everyday usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe&#8217;s presentation entitled, Budget Friendly Usability Testing for WordPress, helped attendees understand what usability testing is, and clarified why it differs from other testing methods. She shares examples from her work showing how small changes can significantly impact user experience, which is better for you, the website builder, and your client, the website owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss how usability testing can transform a website&#8217;s effectiveness by improving conversions. Joe explains the importance of recruiting novice users for testing, and highlights how usability testing pushes for real, user-centered, improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, Jo share&#8217;s practical advice on when and how to integrate usability testing into your process. Advocating for early and iterative testing to preemptively address potential issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to gain a deeper understanding of usability testing and its benefits, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Jo Minney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Jo Minney. Hello, Jo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:06] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Hi. It&#8217;s good to be back again Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, you&#8217;ve been on the podcast before. But this time it&#8217;s different because this time we&#8217;re actually facing each other. Last time we were doing it on, you know, something like Zoom or something like that, but here we are staring at each other because we&#8217;re at WordCamp Asia. We&#8217;re in the Philippines, Manila. It is the second day of the event, kind of. We had Contributor Day yesterday. Today is presentation day. It&#8217;s the first day of the presentations, and you are doing one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:29] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> I&#8217;ve done one actually. I did it at 11 o&#8217;clock this morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How did it go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> It went really well, I think. I had very good feedback from it. Half of the things on my slides didn&#8217;t work. I think that&#8217;s normal for a conference though, and I&#8217;m pretty experienced now at just winging it, and rolling with it anyway, so. It was really exciting because it&#8217;s a topic that I&#8217;m super passionate about and I haven&#8217;t had a chance to speak about it at a conference before. So, yeah, it was really nice to be able to share something that I do on a day-to-day basis and can stand up there and really confidently talk about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever spoken about this subject before in any of the podcasts that I&#8217;ve done. That is quite nice, and it&#8217;s novel. I&#8217;ll just introduce the topic. The presentation that you gave was called Budget-Friendly Usability Testing for WordPress. And obviously that sort of sums it up. We&#8217;re going to talk about usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we do that, Jo, just to nail your colours to the mast a bit, tell us about you. Where you&#8217;re from. What you do for a job, and anything that you think is relevant to this podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:22] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Okay, I really like cats and pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I saw that in your show notes. Why pockets?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:27] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Okay. So I think pockets are a great example of something that can be both a fantastic and a terrible user experience. You are like, oh yeah, maybe I know what you&#8217;re talking about. But, let me ask, do you live with a woman?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:39] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> I know that&#8217;s a very personal question, sorry Nathan. But, how many times on average a month does she complain about not having pockets in her clothing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Never, she carries a bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:50] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah, but why do we have to carry a bag, right? She has to carry a bag because her clothing doesn&#8217;t have pockets. So I spoke at a conference late last year, and I asked this question. This has been a life goal of mine, was to speak about pockets at a conference. And I managed to do it. I asked all of the women in the audience, hands up if you&#8217;ve ever thrown out clothes or gotten rid of them because they didn&#8217;t have pockets in? And every single woman stood up and was like, yes, I&#8217;ve gotten rid of clothes because they didn&#8217;t have pockets in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the people that were there were men. And I said, stand up if you don&#8217;t have pockets in your clothes right now. And 400 men stayed seated. But this is an example of something where, yes, there&#8217;s a subsection of the population that&#8217;s experiencing this problem, but it&#8217;s a big problem for us. It&#8217;s very frustrating. You&#8217;re at a conference, you don&#8217;t want to have to carry around a handbag. So, pockets. They&#8217;re a great example of user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, I get it. I understand now. Tell us a little bit about your sort of day-to-day work, though. You work with WordPress, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:51] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> I do. So I run a small agency. We&#8217;re what I usually call a micro agency, and we have only three of us that are working on the WordPress team. We do website development, but specifically for charities, nonprofits, cause-based organisations, so a lot of social enterprises and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, I also do consulting for user experience research. I&#8217;m not a designer. UX and UI often get lumped together. They&#8217;re very different. UI is about the interface and what people see, and UX is about user experience and how people use things. And they can&#8217;t be completely separated, but they&#8217;re also very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am lucky because I work in the niche that I work in, that I&#8217;m able to do a lot of usability testing and it&#8217;s something that a lot of people don&#8217;t get the experience to do. And so I thought I would share what I&#8217;ve been able to learn over having this sort of unique opportunity to do so much usability testing, and share with people how they can do it more cost effectively, but also the benefit that it can have for a project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s dig into it and I&#8217;m going to actually crib the questions which you posed to the audience today. You put four questions surrounding your subject. And the first one is this. And I&#8217;m sure that the listeners to this podcast, if they&#8217;re anything like me, they&#8217;ll probably have some impression that usability testing is a thing that you could do. And I think the word there is could, as opposed to do, do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine most people have an impression of what it is, but whether or not they do it is another thing altogether. But that would then lead to this. What even is it? So what is usability testing, and what are you actually testing for? So that was a question you posed to the audience and now I&#8217;m throwing it right back at you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:34] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a good question. It&#8217;s probably the sensible place to start. So usability testing is not the same as user testing, or user acceptance testing. And it&#8217;s focusing on, how do we identify what the problems are with something that we have created?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of UX research is focused on what we call quantitative testing. So, meaning we&#8217;re looking for quantities of something. It could be the amount of time it takes someone to do an action. It could be using heat maps. So we have a thousand users, let&#8217;s see where their cursors most often are going. Let&#8217;s see how often they scroll down the page. And quantitative testing is really good at showing you comparisons of whether one thing or another thing works better, but it&#8217;s not actually good at identifying what the problem is, only that there is a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can do a lot of testing and still not know what the problem is. Usability testing is different because it&#8217;s what we call qualitative testing. So it means that we&#8217;re not looking for big numbers, we&#8217;re not looking for lots of data. We are looking for really deep user experience examples. And in a nutshell, the way that that works is you recruit some participants, usually five people per round is ideal. And often I get asked, well, how can you have statistically significant data with only five people? That&#8217;s not the point of qualitative testing. The point of qualitative testing is not to have statistically relevant data, it&#8217;s to have the actual user experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you recruit your people, you come up with your research questions and that&#8217;s the problem that you&#8217;re trying to solve or the question you&#8217;re trying to get an answer to. So, an example might be, are users going to recognise this label that I&#8217;ve used in my navigation? Is this button going to get clicked if I put it in this location? It&#8217;s often a thing that, if you&#8217;re working with a customer to develop a website for them, what we find is that often the things that we are testing for in usability testing are things that the customer and I disagree on, or things where they weren&#8217;t sure when they made the decision in the first place. And they&#8217;re a great example of things that you want to test for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the research questions are only the first part because if I say, the example I used in my talk today is that we had a support service directory. And this was for people who are experiencing family domestic violence. And they didn&#8217;t want to use the term directory because it&#8217;s a very harsh term. So they had called it support services, which sounds, on the surface like a good idea, but a lot of the people that are using their platform are not English first language. And they also tend to be in a really stressed out state as you can imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so what we actually found is that when we said to them, can you imagine you&#8217;re helping someone, can you help them find a legal service that will enable them to get a restraining order or something like this? What we found is that repeatedly they didn&#8217;t go to support services to start with. The minute we changed that to service directory, they started to find the thing that we wanted them to click on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such a small change, but it made a huge impact, the usability. Now, we found that out after the second test, which meant that we were able to change it after the second test, and then we had three more tests where we could show that every time they were able to find the thing that we wanted them to be looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is an example where the research question and the research task or the activity that we&#8217;re giving to the user, they&#8217;re not the same thing. If we said to them, find support services, find the service directory, if we use that language, obviously they&#8217;re going to look for that label. But instead we asked them to do an activity that would hopefully take them to the place we wanted them to go to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the last step is to iterate that and to actually take that data and make decisions, and make improvements to the project iteratively to try and make it better. That&#8217;s the goal, right? Is to find what the problems are and fix them. So we still have to work out how to fix them, but at least we know what the problems are and not just that people were not clicking on the button and we don&#8217;t know why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I have a couple of follow up questions. First thing isn&#8217;t the question, it&#8217;s an observation. So that&#8217;s really cleared up in my head what it is, so that&#8217;s amazing. But one of the things that I want to know from that is, do you filter out people who, let&#8217;s say for example, you&#8217;ve got a website, the kind that you just described. Do you filter out people who are not the target audience? So in other words, I don&#8217;t know, maybe that&#8217;s not a perfect example. But let&#8217;s say, on some websites, would it be better to have really inexperienced users of the internet as your five candidates?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:59] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> That is exactly the ideal person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So people who are just, I&#8217;ve never come across this before. You want people who are potentially bound to be confused. If somebody&#8217;s going to be confused, it&#8217;s you five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:10] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> That is the ideal participant for a usability study. And often people say, I want to start learning how to do usability testing. Where should I start? And my advice to them is always the same, with your mum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recruit a person that&#8217;s a generation older than you, because I can guarantee that in most cases, sorry to generalise, but they tend to be less efficient and less used to technology because they haven&#8217;t grown up with it. So for millennials and younger, we have had technology for all of our adult lives and most of our childhood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my parents&#8217; generation, they have had to learn that technology as an adult, and so their brains have a different mental model, and they don&#8217;t take for granted things that we take for granted. Like, when I click the logo, it will take me back to the homepage. I know that, you know that, your mum might not know that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that is something that is really valuable is to understand the benefit of testing with people who aren&#8217;t as experienced with technology. Who don&#8217;t speak English as a first language. Who are experiencing some kind of accessibility challenge. Whether that&#8217;s using assistive technology, being colorblind. Things like that are really good things to try and get some cross-sectional representation in your testing participant pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the idea then is that you&#8217;ve got these novice users who hopefully will immediately illustrate the point. And it&#8217;s driven by questions. So it&#8217;s not just, we are just going to stand over your shoulder and watch you browse the internet, and when you do something and describe, you&#8217;re looking for something and you can&#8217;t find it, that&#8217;s not how it&#8217;s done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s more, okay, here&#8217;s a defined task, do this thing and we&#8217;re going to ask you to do five things today, we want you to achieve them all and describe what you&#8217;re doing, but it&#8217;s more of that process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the idea is that you go from an imperfect website, slowly over time, iterating one problem after another towards a better website. The goal is never reached. It&#8217;s just an iterative process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:01] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> That&#8217;s it. Perfection does not exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so that&#8217;s interesting. So we start with the novice. We&#8217;ve got a small cohort of people. We ask them specific questions, and we get feedback about those specific questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the other thing that I wanted to ask then is, when do you do it? Because it feels like you need to build the website first, then show it to people. So there&#8217;s got to be something. This isn&#8217;t process of discovery prior to the website. You need pixels on pages. Buttons that are potentially mislabeled or what have you. Is that the case? Build first, then usability test afterwards. There&#8217;s no usability testing prior to the initial build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:37] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of a trick question because you can usability test at most stages. Probably the only stage you can&#8217;t usability test at is when you don&#8217;t yet have a site map. Having said that, my recommendation is, assuming you had unlimited budget and unlimited time, I would do at minimum two rounds of usability testing, and I would do one before you have any design, and I would do it just using wire frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we build interactive wire frames using WordPress. So for the demo that I did today, I spun one up. I used InstaWP. You can get like a seven day website or something through there. It took me 42 minutes to build out the website in just the block editor, with no design or anything, just the layout of it. And I was eating a loaded potato at the time. So if I can do that in 42 minutes, eating a loaded potato, and that&#8217;s not my job, I think it&#8217;s a pretty efficient and cost effective way of being able to do early usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And often the thing that we&#8217;re testing for there is like, have I got the right navigation structure and hierarchy? Are the labels that I&#8217;m using sensible for people? Do they fit with the mental models of what our users are actually expecting? And the benefit of doing it that early is that when you don&#8217;t have a design applied, it&#8217;s a lot easier to identify problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there is a thing that happens in human psychology, and there&#8217;s a lot of psychology in user experience. And there&#8217;s a thing that happens where if something&#8217;s pretty, we will say that it is easier to use. Our experience is that it&#8217;s easier to use because it&#8217;s nice to look at. And that&#8217;s great. That means that UI is really important, but it also means that, if you have a really nice UI, it can mask problems that you have in the background. It is great that things can be easier if they&#8217;re pretty, but imagine how much easier they would be if they worked well and were pretty, that&#8217;s what we should be aiming for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So typically we would do one round of usability testing when we just have a framework and just have the navigation. When someone lands on a page, sometimes we&#8217;ll just write a message on there and say, congratulations, you found the service directory where you can find this thing, this thing, this thing, this thing, and then we put a little button there. When they click it, it releases confetti on the page. So they get a dopamine hit and it&#8217;s like, yay, I completed the activity. You don&#8217;t have to have all of your content in place to be able to do testing, and identify early that you&#8217;ve got problems that you need to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It sounds almost like an overly complicated design is the enemy of usability. We are drawn towards beautiful, but sometimes maybe beautiful just is overwhelming. You know, there&#8217;s lots of colors on the page, the buttons get hidden, there&#8217;s just too much text on there. Looks great, but it might be sort of masking the thing that you&#8217;re really trying to show. And it feels like there&#8217;s this tight rope act of trying to balance one thing against the other. Yeah, that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, with the wire frame thing, in that case, you are really just testing, can the person find the thing? But I&#8217;m guessing once you&#8217;ve move beyond the wire frame stage and you&#8217;ve got a website, it&#8217;s literally out on the internet, it&#8217;s functional. It&#8217;s exactly what we hope would be the perfect version, then you&#8217;re drilling into more detail. You know, can a person find this resource? Do they know that this button is what we are intending them to click? Those kind of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:49] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah. So I think things like searchability and discoverability are much easier to test for in the early stages when you&#8217;re just doing, say, using like a wire frame or a prototype. And things like usability, you really do need to have the complete designed product to be able to test for them well. And I say that, there&#8217;s actually kind of four categories of the different types of tasks that we can do. I&#8217;ll give you the link to the blog post that I wrote that has all of this in detail because we do not have time to go deep into that today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But things like, does my search form work the way that I want it to? They&#8217;re the sorts of things that you do have to do some development to be able to get them working. So it&#8217;s not always practical to do that at the very early stages when you do want to start testing your navigation and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that you can do is if you&#8217;ve only got enough budget, or enough time, to be able to do, say, five usability tests total, you could do two of them early, and then you could do three of them towards the end, after you have the majority of the design and the development work in place. Users are pretty forgiving when they&#8217;re doing a usability test. If you say, this is still a work in progress, there might be a couple of pages that look odd and aren&#8217;t quite ready to go live yet. If you get somewhere and you&#8217;re not sure, you can just go back, it&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not meant to be a perfect experience. The point is that you are getting their real time thoughts and feedback as they&#8217;re doing it. So it&#8217;s really important that you try and encourage them to follow the think aloud protocol, which is really outlining every single thing that goes through they&#8217;re head, just brain dump on me please. Like, I just want to hear all of your thoughts and thought processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the only thing as the facilitator that I will say during a usability test is, tell me what you&#8217;re thinking. And other than that, I am completely silent. So even when it comes to giving them the activity, so if I&#8217;m asking you to do an activity like help somebody find a legal service that they can use in this particular state. I would actually send that task to you via the chat or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would send the task to you via the chat, and then I would get you to read that task back to me, because I don&#8217;t want you to be thinking about how I&#8217;m saying it. I want you to be able to go back to that task and look at it, and think about it, and process everything inside your own head. But I want you to be telling me all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So often we&#8217;ll find people ask questions during that, like, what should I do next? And the answer to that is really hard to train yourself out of replying to them with anything other than, what would you do if I wasn&#8217;t here? And I think that&#8217;s the hardest thing about learning to facilitate a usability test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, and in a sort of an ideal scenario, you wouldn&#8217;t even be in the room. But in some strange way, you&#8217;d be able to just get into their head and say, okay, now I want you to do this, but every time you&#8217;ve got problem, just figure figure it out, and we&#8217;ll watch. But you have to be there because you have to be able to listen to what they&#8217;re saying and what have you. Yeah, that&#8217;s curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:40] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah, and we do, at the end of each activity, we&#8217;ll then ask them for feedback on how they found it. If they had any suggestions or things that they didn&#8217;t say out loud while they were doing it that they wanted to share with us. How confident were they with the activity, and did they think that they were successful in it, which is a really good way of telling, I wasn&#8217;t really sure what the activity was meant to do. Or I wasn&#8217;t really sure if what I found really met the needs that I was looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we ask them, how certain are you with the answer that you just gave? And if they&#8217;re like, three out of five, you&#8217;re like, alright, this person didn&#8217;t understand what it was that I was asking them to do in the first place. Maybe the problem is actually with my question and not with the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so the whole process is, you&#8217;re not just asking for feedback about the website, there&#8217;s a whole process of asking for feedback about the process as well which is, that&#8217;s kind of curious. Meta, meta processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:27] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Very meta, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re in an industry where at the moment everything is trying to be automated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:32] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Is this the AI question?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, no, this feels like it&#8217;s a very human thing. You need actual bodies on the ground. So it&#8217;s really a question of economics. Because I&#8217;m wondering if this often turns out to be a fairly expensive process. And because of that, I wonder if people push against it, because the budgets may not be there. If this is something that clients typically would say, well, okay, tell me how much that&#8217;s going to cost. It&#8217;s a nice idea but, okay, it&#8217;s going to cost us X thousand dollars because we&#8217;ve got to put five people in a room and we&#8217;ve got to pay for your time to moderate the event, and come up with the questions and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we manage that in an era of automation where everything is, the dollar cost of everything has got to be driven down. This feels like the dollar cost is going up because there&#8217;s humans involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:14] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a great question. Have you ever run a Google ad before?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> It&#8217;s very expensive. It&#8217;s very expensive to get a new lead. It&#8217;s a lot more cost effective to convert a lead than it is to get a new one. And the point of usability testing is to improve conversion of people being able to do the thing that you want them to do on the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my first answer to that would be, look at the cost benefit analysis. It&#8217;s worth it in most cases to do usability testing. Something that we&#8217;ve found with positioning of usability testing is that if we offer it as an add-on, then people don&#8217;t want to do it because they don&#8217;t want to pay for it. They see the value in it necessarily. However, we don&#8217;t offer it as an add-on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We actually have it just as part of our proposal right from the start where we&#8217;re like, this is part of the point of difference between what you get when you build with us versus when you build with someone else. They&#8217;ll tell you what they think is the best way to do something. If we are unsure about the best way to do something or we disagree on it, it&#8217;s not going to ultimately be me making a decision or you making a decision. We&#8217;re going to test and we&#8217;re going to get real evidence from customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they&#8217;re the ones that are going to be developing it so you know that the final result that you get is going to be the best possible version of the website. And often we might be more expensive than our competitors, but people will go with us because we are not competing on price. We&#8217;re competing on offering a service that nobody else is offering. I asked today in the presentation who has done usability testing before and not a single person put their hand up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That would&#8217;ve been my assumption actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:44] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah. And honestly, I don&#8217;t think any of the people that we&#8217;re competing against in the industry that I&#8217;m in are doing the same thing as what we&#8217;re doing. And so it is very much a point of difference. I think it&#8217;s not a well understood technique, but it&#8217;s so valuable that it is a really easy way to position yourself as being different, and really actually do a better job for your customers, for the people that you&#8217;re building websites for. Because ultimately you are going to have a better result at the end of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The interesting thing there is, when I say usability testing, somehow in my head there is a connection between that and accessibility. And that&#8217;s not where I&#8217;m going with this question, but there&#8217;s just something about it being unnecessary. And I&#8217;m not binding that to the word accessibility. What I&#8217;m saying is clients often think, I don&#8217;t need to do that. Obviously, we&#8217;re moving into an era where legislation says otherwise. But I can just leave it over there. I don&#8217;t need to worry about that, usability testing, not for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the lever that you&#8217;ve just pulled, it completely changes the dynamic because you&#8217;ve pulled an economic lever, which is that if we can get everybody to follow this action, I don&#8217;t know, fill up the cart with widgets and then press the buy now button, and go through the checkout process. If that&#8217;s the thing that you&#8217;re usability testing, you&#8217;ve made direct line. You&#8217;ve joined up the dots of, okay, user, money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s not just about it being a better website so that people can browse around it all day. It&#8217;s also about connecting the economics of it. So the usability is about people buying, converting, getting the resource. And so there might not be an economic transfer there, but it will be some benefit to your business. There might be downloading that valuable PDF that you want everybody to see or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s kind of interesting. That&#8217;s changed my thoughts about it a little bit. And it is more about that. It&#8217;s getting an understanding of what you want out the website, getting an understanding of what you think should be happening is actually possible and happening. Have I sort of summed that up about right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:40] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s a really good summary it. I think the only thing I would add there is that a lot of the times the conversation around accessibility and the conversation around usability do have a lot of crossover. They are fundamentally different, but one of my favorite examples is actually something that I think applies to both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So two of the common problems that we find very early on in design is often to do with colour. And so one of them is colour contrast and the other one is colourblind accessibility. And I think it&#8217;s a great way to get people to change their thinking, and their perception of the way we have these conversations is, if you have an e-commerce website, Nathan, what would you say if I said to you, I can instantly get you 8% more customers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:24] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> And I&#8217;d be like, cool, change your buttons so that colourblind people can read them, because 8% of men are colourblind. So actually it&#8217;s only 4% of people because assuming half of them are men, then you&#8217;ve actually only got 4%. But still 8% of men are colourblind, that&#8217;s a big percentage of the population. So if your button is red and green, then you&#8217;re going to have a problem. People are not going to be able to find the thing that you want them to click to give you their money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, if you want people to be able to use your website when they&#8217;re outside and using their phone in sunlight, then you need to have good colour contrast on your website. So often this conversation is around, well, I don&#8217;t have people who are disabled, I&#8217;m not trying to cater to people that are using screen readers. It doesn&#8217;t matter because not very many people that are using my website are blind. And I&#8217;m like, well, I&#8217;m not blind but I still struggle when I&#8217;m looking at something where the text is too faint, and I&#8217;m looking at it on my phone, and I&#8217;m standing outside in the sun because we naturally don&#8217;t visualise as much contrast there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think being able to position it in a way where people can see the value to themselves. I want to use a website that has better contrast, and so it makes that conversation easier with a customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I hadn&#8217;t really drawn the line between accessibility and usability, but it seems like they&#8217;re partner topics, basically. There&#8217;s like a Venn diagram, accessibility over here, usability over here, with a massive overlap somewhere in the middle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:43] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> A hundred percent. That&#8217;s why we always encourage having that sort of intersection between accessibility and usability in our testing pool. So we always try and have one person who experiences some kind of accessibility challenge, whether that&#8217;s being colourblind, hearing impaired, if we&#8217;ve got a lot of video on the site, for example. And I think that it can be a really valuable way of collecting multiple data points at one time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When you have a client that comes to you and they&#8217;ve obviously, by the time that they&#8217;ve signed the contract with you, usability is already part of the deal it sounds like. How do you decide, what&#8217;s the thing in round one that we&#8217;re going to pick up on? Is there sort of like a copy book that you go through? Is it like, I don&#8217;t know, buttons or the checkout or colour or? Where do you go first? And sort of attached to that question a little bit, this process never ends, right? In theory, you could do usability testing each month. But I was wondering if you did it like on an annual cycle or something, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:34] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> If you&#8217;re not changing stuff super often, I would say, there&#8217;s probably more cost effective ways that you can collect information about it. Typically we encourage, long-term, have things like heat maps and stuff like that. They will help you identify if there is a problem. If you know that there is a problem, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve got a heat map and you&#8217;re like, why is nobody clicking on our buy now link? That is a good instance of where you would do some usability testing to figure out what the problem is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if everything&#8217;s working and you&#8217;re getting conversions, then probably doing usability testing isn&#8217;t the most valuable thing that you can do. If you&#8217;re looking at making significant changes to the way that your website works, that&#8217;s another good time to introduce a round of usability testing. So we don&#8217;t do it just for the sake of doing it. We do it because we need to do it, and because there&#8217;s value in it for our customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you keep an eye on your customer&#8217;s websites so that you can sort of get ahead of that, if you know what I mean? So let&#8217;s say that you put heat maps in, very often that would then get handed over to the client and it&#8217;s somebody in the client&#8217;s company&#8217;s job is to check the heat maps. Or do you keep an eye on that and, oh look, curiously, we&#8217;ve seen over the last 12 months, yeah, look at that. There&#8217;s not much going on over at that very important button over there. Let&#8217;s go back to the client and discuss that. That could be another round of usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:44] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah, so I think we&#8217;re not uncommonly, a lot of agencies now do have some kind of retainer program where they will maintain communication and assistance for their clients. So we call them care plans. I know everyone has a different name for it. I think it&#8217;s pretty standard now in the WordPress ecosystem. It&#8217;s a very common thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of our care plans we have scheduled meeting with our clients once every three months or six months or 12 months, depending on how big the site is. And one of the things that we&#8217;ll do at that time is review their analytics, review the heat maps, that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask them, have they experienced any problems? Have they noticed a downturn in the people signing up for the memberships? Or have they noticed, have they had any complaints from people about something? Is there anything that they&#8217;re not sure about? Are they going to be changing the way that they operate soon, and introducing something new into their navigation that we need to consider where does that fit in the grand scheme of things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find if we&#8217;re having those conversations early and we are the ones starting those conversations, then often we are coming to them with solutions instead of them coming to us with problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think that&#8217;s the key bit, isn&#8217;t it? If you can prove to be the partner that comes with, we&#8217;ve got this intuition that there&#8217;s something that we can explore here. You are proactive, you&#8217;re going to them not, okay, anything you want? Is there anything we can help you with, you know? And the answer to that is always, not really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas if you go and say, look, we&#8217;ve got this idea, based upon some data that we&#8217;ve seen, we&#8217;ve got heat maps and what have you, shall we explore that further? That seems much more credible. You are far likely, I think to have an economic wheel which keeps spinning if you adopt that approach, as opposed to the is there anything you want doing, kind of approach?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:18] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Absolutely. I think every developer&#8217;s worst nightmare is having a customer come back to them and say, I&#8217;ve just noticed that I haven&#8217;t had anyone send through anything in my contact form for the last three weeks. And I&#8217;ve just noticed, when I went and tested it, that the contact form&#8217;s not working anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve had that nightmare at least once. And I think if you can avoid being in that situation where they&#8217;re coming to you with something like, oh my God, it&#8217;s broken, how do I fix it? If instead you can go to them and be proactive about it and just kind of keep your finger on the pulse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, there&#8217;s a little bit of ongoing work, but like honestly, I jump on, I check all of the analytics maybe once every three months for my clients. I set aside one day to do it. Go and have a look through that. If I notice anything, I can usually fix it, make sure that we&#8217;re collecting the data again before it becomes a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then that way when there is an issue, we&#8217;ve got data that we can back up and we can start from there and go, okay, yes, we&#8217;ve identified, here&#8217;s where we need to do more research. And then we can apply something like usability testing to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How much of your time on a monthly basis, let&#8217;s say as a percentage, do you spend on usability of existing clients? Is this something that is a lot of the work that you do? What I&#8217;m trying to figure out here is, for people listening, is this something that they can turn into a real engine of their business?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you might get two days, three days work a week just on the usability of pre-existing clients. So in a sense, you&#8217;ve created interest and work out of thin air, because these clients already exist, they&#8217;re in your roster, but there&#8217;s a whole new thing that we can offer to them. So, how much do you spend doing it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:50] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah, so it&#8217;s a great question. I would say it&#8217;s cyclical. I couldn&#8217;t really say like, I always spend this much amount of time. There might be entire weeks that go by where my whole life is usability testing, and there might be a month that goes by where I don&#8217;t do any. And it really does often depend on where our projects are in the life cycle at any particular time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re often working on projects that will span over years. And because of that, they might introduce a completely new part of their project. And that&#8217;s a good time to reintroduce that usability testing. As I said, like you don&#8217;t really want to do it just for the sake of doing it, but at the same time, if you can show that there will be value in making a change, if you can show that there is a lost opportunity somewhere, then a hundred percent you can sell that, the value to them of, hey, you could spend $1,000 now, but you could be earning $5,000 more every month for the next several years. That&#8217;s a no-brainer, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are happy to make investment if they can see that there&#8217;s going to be a cost benefit for them in the future. Or if the thing that they&#8217;re trying to do is maybe their government website or something, and they&#8217;ve got a particular thing that they need to meet, they&#8217;ve got KPIs. If you can show that you are able to help them meet those KPIs, then they are going to invest in doing that thing that you&#8217;re trying to offer them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We talked about the Venn diagram of accessibility and usability, and the fact that there&#8217;s a lot of an overlap. In the year 2025, this is a year where, in Europe at least anyway, accessibility, the legal cogs are turning and the screw is getting tighter. So accessibility is becoming mandated in many respects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was wondering about that, whether there was any kind of overlap in legislation on the usability side. The accessibility piece is obviously easier to sort of define in many ways, and it&#8217;s going to become less optional. But I was wondering if there was any usability legal requirements. I don&#8217;t know quite how that would be encapsulated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:41] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Sort of. An example that comes to mind is that there are a lot of practices that historically have been really prevalent on the internet, and they&#8217;ve been identified as being really bad for usability. And they&#8217;ve actually now been identified as being so bad that they&#8217;re almost evil. And they&#8217;ve started to crack down on those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And an example of that is, have you ever tried to unsubscribe from a gym? It&#8217;s basically impossible. And so now if you, at least in Australia, I know if you have a subscription on your site, you legally have to have a way of people being able to unsubscribe without having to call someone or send an email somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is an example where that is actually usability. And I think there are definitely things where we are picking up on stuff that is maybe a shady way of working, and a shady way of developing websites. And those things are starting, we&#8217;re starting to cut down on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if that is purely usability, or just like not being being a bad person. But I think that there is definitely, the only reason that we know that those things are a problem is because we have all had those bad experiences. And ultimately that&#8217;s all user experience is, it&#8217;s just how good or bad is experience of using a platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I share your frustration with those kind of things because I&#8217;ve been through that process. Not just canceling a subscription but, I don&#8217;t know, something that you&#8217;ve got yourself accidentally into and you don&#8217;t want to be on that email list anymore. Seemingly no way to get off it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:01] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> They&#8217;ve changed the unsubscribe link so it doesn&#8217;t have the word unsubscribe in it. And now you just have to look for the word that&#8217;s not underlined, or highlighted in a different colour. That when you hover over it, something pops up and you&#8217;re like, oh, that&#8217;s the link. That thing that says manage preferences down the bottom, hidden in the wall of text. That is a shady practice. That is a poor user experience just as much as it&#8217;s just a bad thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s got the label of deceptive design now. It used to be called dark patterns, didn&#8217;t it? But deceptive design. This notion of doing things in such a way to just deliberately confuse the user so that the green big button, which is the exact opposite of what you want to click, is the one which is visible. And then there&#8217;s this tiny little bit of greyed out text, which is the one which, clearly, you&#8217;ve ended up at this page, that&#8217;s the one you want. That&#8217;s the enemy of usability in a way. But for the business, it may be exactly what they want because it keeps the economic engine rolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s interesting. I wonder if there&#8217;ll be more legislation to tighten those things up so that they&#8217;re not allowed. Yeah, that&#8217;s fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last question. We&#8217;re running out of time. Last question. And it refers to something that we talked about earlier. I&#8217;m guessing this really never ends. This is a journey which you begin, you tweak it, you do a little bit, you fix, and then you start again a little bit later and what have you. Is there ever a moment though where you go to a client and say, we did it? This site, as far as we&#8217;re concerned, is now perfect. Or is it never a goal? It&#8217;s a journey and never a destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:23] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> I think you&#8217;ll probably agree with me here, Nathan, that it&#8217;s basically impossible to be perfect, because ultimately someone is always going to have a different opinion. Someone&#8217;s always going to think that your shade of purple is too dark. Someone is always going to dislike the font that you chose, because it&#8217;s not loopy enough, or it&#8217;s too loopy, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t think there is such a thing as perfect. But through doing five usability tests, five people, you can pick up at least 85% of the potential problems with your design. And I&#8217;m not aiming for perfect, but I know that for me, if I can confidently say to my customers that I&#8217;ve been able to identify 85% of the potential problems that they might experience in their project, then they can confidently go away and say, hey, we&#8217;re pretty happy with what we&#8217;ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can definitely improve on that over time. But that is a huge milestone to be able to hit. And being able to have enough data, and enough research to confidently say that, I think is a really big win both for us and for our customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Sadly, Jo, time is the enemy, and I feel like we&#8217;ve just pulled back the lid a teeny tiny bit on the big subject of usability. Honestly, I reckon I could talk for another two hours on this at least. You know, because you&#8217;ve got into colours there and all sorts, and there&#8217;s just so many tendrils that we haven&#8217;t been able to explore. But we&#8217;ve prized it open a little bit, and so hopefully the listener to this has become curious. If they have, where would they find you? What&#8217;s a good place to discover you online?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:53] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> Yeah, so I think the best place is to hit up my personal blog, jominney.com. So it&#8217;s J O M I N N E Y .com. And I have a lot of stuff on there about usability, usability testing. I have a blog post that I wrote specifically for this talk that shares all of the resources that I used to put together the slides and everything. The talk itself will be on WordCamp TV. If you&#8217;re on socials and you want to hit me up, pretty much the only platforms I&#8217;m active on nowadays are LinkedIn and Bluesky, and I&#8217;m Jo Minney on both of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Jo Minney, thank you so much for chatting to me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:27] <strong>Jo Minney:</strong> You&#8217;re most welcome, Nathan. Thanks for having me again.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I bring you the first in a mini series of podcasts I recorded in person at <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/\">WordCamp Asia in Manila</a>. This flagship WordPress event brought together hundreds of WordPress professionals, enthusiasts and all manner of interested parties under one roof for a three day event &#8211; one contributor day, and two days of presentations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tracked down several of the speakers and workshop organisers, and recorded them speaking about the subject they were presenting upon. I hope that you enjoy what they have to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have the first of those conversations, and it’s with Jo Minney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jo, based in Perth, Australia, is passionate about user experience, data-driven decision-making, cats, pockets and travel. She&#8217;s a small business founder, and works with organisations creating digital platforms with WordPress. She also freelances as a UX consultant. She volunteers with Mission Digital to address social issues using technology, and is an ambassador for She Codes Australia, promoting tech accessibility for women. Recognised as a 2023 Shining Star by Women in Technology Western Australia, Jo is an international speaker on topics like user experience, accessibility, and gender equality. She&#8217;s committed to ensuring a seamless user experience, and today shares her insights from practical, everyday usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jo’s presentation, entitled <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/session/budget-friendly-usability-testing-for-wordpress/\">Budget-Friendly Usability Testing for WordPress</a> helped attendees understand what usability testing is, x and clarified why it differs from other testing methods. She shares examples from her work, showing how small changes can significantly impact user experience, which is better for you, the website builder, and your client, the website owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss how usability testing can transform a website&#8217;s effectiveness by improving conversions. Jo explains the importance of recruiting novice users for testing, and highlights how usability testing pushes for real, user-centered improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, Jo shares practical advice on when and how to integrate usability testing into your process, advocating for early and iterative testing to preemptively address potential issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to gain a deeper understanding of usability testing and its benefits, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/\">WordCamp Asia in Manila</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jo&#8217;s WordCamp Asia 2025 presentation: <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/session/budget-friendly-usability-testing-for-wordpress/\">Budget-Friendly Usability Testing for WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://instawp.com/\">InstaWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol\">Think Aloud Protocol</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jominney.com/\">Jo Minney&#8217;s website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jominney.bsky.social\">Jo on Bluesky</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 18:37:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"Do The Woo Community: Building Trust and Converting Sales with Simple UX Decisions with Marc McDougall\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=93465\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://dothewoo.io/building-trust-and-converting-sales-with-simple-ux-decisions-with-marc-mcdougall/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:198:\"In this episode of Woo DevChat, hosts discuss UX design and CRO with Marc McDougall, who shares insights on common misconceptions, mistakes, and the evolving role of AI in enhancing user experience.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 15:58:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Do The Woo Community: Get Ready for the Atarim Web Agency Summit 2025\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://dothewoo.io/?post_type=blog&p=93450\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/get-ready-for-the-atarim-web-agency-summit-2025/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:359:\"The Atarim Web Agency Summit 2025, scheduled for April 7-11, is a free virtual event for web professionals.

At a party, you’ll usually find me talking to the dog (or cat). Throughout my life, I’ve only had a few close friends, and I’d rather be reading a book than going to a concert. While WordPress has been a huge part of the growth of my business, I’d like to take this opportunity to discuss something much more important &#8211; the friendships that I have formed through this wonderful community. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Due to WordPress, I have some truly spectacular friends in my life. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While we may have started as strangers, we moved into attending each other’s weddings, laughing until we’re crying while packing hundreds of swag orders, holding hands in a hospital bed and being there for each other through thick and thin. Being a privacy lawyer, I won’t name any names here but you’ll probably be able to tell pretty quickly if I’m writing this about you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_98f5b2-d1 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>A little backstory&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was finishing up law school, I worked at a small web design agency in Chicago as their COO. I met my husband, Hans, who was the owner of a different agency when he came to buy us out. It was love at first sight (yes, really) and we have been inseparable ever since. We shared our struggles and annoyances over dinner one night &#8211; writing Privacy Policies for clients was monotonous for me and he had no idea what to do when a client asked him about website policies. So we created Termageddon &#8211; an auto-updating website policies solution for agencies and their clients. Since we started an agency partner program, we knew that we had to find agencies who would be willing to try our new product and that’s when we came across WordCamps and the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_4b5f95-0c wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Our first WordCamp&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has a huge community and going to a large WordCamp such as WordCamp US when you don’t know anyone can be really scary (especially for an introvert like me) so we thought that we’d get our feet wet with a smaller WordCamp nearby. Enter WordCamp Jackson, Michigan. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Driving into the most adorable small city that we have ever visited, we were very nervous &#8211; what if no one wanted to talk to us?&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>These fears were quickly dispelled when we walked into a room with about 30 friendly faces. Even the mayor was in attendance! During a break, we all sat on couches and our new friends helped us come up with the design for our very first swag item: a t-shirt with a pirate asking “Arrrr you compliant?”. I still smile every time I put it on. The next thing we know, the informative presentations are over and we’re all piling into cars and going to an escape room. The friendships formed during that event have lasted many years. In fact, one of our friends from that very first WordCamp helped us build our chicken coop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_9ad00d-0c wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Come on over!&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A while later, my husband went to London and met a friend through a non-WordPress event and they truly hit it off (seriously, they have a standing call twice per month for five years now). A few months later, it was time for our first WordCamp US and our friend flew from the UK to Chicago to stay with us and our plan was to take a road trip and drive from our home to the WordCamp. Well, it just so happened that his other friend who was also going to WordCamp (someone we haven’t met before), missed his flight. Our friend called us to explain the situation and asked whether he could change his flight to Chicago, stay with us and join our road trip. We said “come on over!” Well, that missed flight led to the best trip of all time and a lifelong friendship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll always remember him walking me to the store to buy some tea on a cold evening, all of us posing for a picture next to the St. Louis arch, hanging out in various hotels and Airbnb’s throughout the years, sharing stories from our youth, marveling at the excitement and joy of growing families, and supporting each other’s business ventures. We’ve seen each other many times throughout the years on various trips and WordCamps and I think of us as our core group at these events &#8211; a safe space amidst all of the chaos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_fed9f2-cd wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Better together&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you start establishing yourself in an industry or a community, you may think of other people in the space as competitors. While it’s certainly not the best trait that humanity has to offer, I think that this happens more frequently than we would like to admit. When I was new in the WordPress community, there was an established privacy attorney who had been a part of that community for much longer than I have. Going to WordCamp US, I knew that she was going to be giving a speech on the California Consumer Privacy Act and how to comply with this privacy law. To be honest with myself and you, I was extremely nervous about meeting her. What if she thought that I was a competitor? What if she disliked me? What if there’s not enough room for two privacy lawyers at this event? Should I just hide throughout the entire event to make sure that she doesn’t see me?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s true that we create these extreme scenarios in our minds but reality is usually much different (and less scary). We quickly bonded over the fact that we were the only two people there who knew what CCPA even is and, by the end of the night, we were jammed together in an Uber going to a bar. Throughout the years, we have supported each other’s projects, participated in long evenings of conversations, shared our struggles and wins. Due to her kindness and welcoming nature, we did not head towards competition but are able to enjoy the benefits of a wonderful symbiosis and a true friendship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_3b4a8f-db wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Family for life&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hanging out with your friends at WordCamps is fun but it’s even more fun when your friendship progresses to the point where your friends fly over to hang out at your home. Well, in this case, we only got to hang out for one day before my friend got very sick. Not the “I have the flu” kind of sick, the over a week in the ICU and months in the hospital kind of sick.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout that time, we met her family, who stayed with us for a while as we live very close to the hospital. While this time was certainly grueling for everyone involved, it also shed a new perspective on how friends get through tough times. Whether it was rides to the hospital, sitting together, crying together, making home cooked meals, celebrating every win, no matter how small, the friendship, the community, and the knowledge that we were there for each other let us make it through this difficult time. The day that she got out of the hospital was truly miraculous. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>And now, we are most certainly not just WordCamp friends, we’re family &#8211; for life.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_9ed1fb-ed wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>The little things&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to this point in my life, I have been a part of many communities &#8211; from school, to dance groups, to attorney associations, to my local neighborhood, each community has had something special to offer. However, I have never been involved with another community that is as welcoming or that has led to the formation of so many wonderful friendships as WordPress. From sharing a beer (or a boot of beer), to attending our wedding through Zoom (2020), to making a flower crown, to eating so much sushi that I could barely walk back to the Airbnb, to corn mazes and petting zoos, and touring a submarine together, I am truly thankful that the WordPress community has welcomed me with open arms and I hope that I can do the same for others!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id7820_98ca3a-9c alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\" id=\"desktop\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column7820_0ce1fa-54\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<h2 id=\"work-environment\" class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_ee2be6-f0 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Donata&#8217;s Work Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked Donata for a view of her office this is what she sent!</p>\n\n\n	<div class=\"hotspots-image-container\">\n		<img width=\"1512\" height=\"2016\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donata-desktop.webp\" alt=\"Donata Stroink-Skillrud&#8217;s Desk\" class=\"hotspots-image skip-lazy\" />\n	</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_c82817-0e wp-block-kadence-advancedheading has-theme-palette-9-background-color has-background\">HeroPress would like to thank <a href=\"https://wpdrawattention.com/\">Draw Attention</a> for their donation of the plugin to make this interactive image!</p>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"lithuanian\" class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_8d3626-a3 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Su atviromis rankomis – draugystės WordPress bendruomenėje</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiesą sakant, kitaip nei mano vyras, niekada nebuvau pati socialiausia asmenybė. Vakarėlyje mane dažniausiai rastumėte kalbančią su šunimi (ar kate). Visą savo gyvenimą turėjau tik keletą artimų draugų, o knygos skaitymas man visada buvo malonesnis nei koncerto lankymas. Nors WordPress atliko didžiulį vaidmenį plėtojant mano verslą, norėčiau pasinaudoti šia proga ir pakalbėti apie kai ką daug svarbesnio – draugystes, kurias užmezgiau šioje nuostabioje bendruomenėje. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Dėl WordPress turiu iš tiesų nuostabių draugų savo gyvenime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Nors pradėjome kaip svetimi, mes tapome tais, kurie dalyvauja vienas kito vestuvėse, juokiasi iki ašarų pakuodami šimtus reklaminių dovanų, laiko vienas kitam ranką ligonines lovoje ir būna kartu per storą ir ploną. Kadangi esu privatumo teisininkė, nemininesiu vardų, tačiau tikriausiai greitai suprasite, jei rašau apie jus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_2b2aa1-eb wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Trumpa istorija</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kai baiginėjau teisės studijas, dirbau mažoje interneto dizaino agentūroje Čikagoje kaip COO. Ten sutikau savo vyrą Hansą, kuris buvo kitos agentūros savininkas, kai jis atvyko mus nupirkti. Tai buvo meilė iš pirmo žvilgsnio (taip, tikrai), ir nuo to laiko mes esame neatskiriami. Vieną vakarą dalinomės savo sunkumais ir nepasitenkinimais – man buvo nuobodu rašyti privatumo politikos dokumentus klientams, o jis net nežinojo, ką daryti, kai klientas paprašydavo interneto svetainės politikos. Taip gimė Termageddon – automatiškai atnaujinamas interneto svetainių politikos sprendimas agentūroms ir jų klientams. Kadangi pradėjome agentūrų partnerių programą, turėjome rasti agentūras, kurios būtų pasiruošusios išbandyti mūsų naują produktą, ir tada mes atradome WordCamps ir WordPress bendruomenę.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_b441b2-d1 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Mūsų pirmasis WordCamp</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress turi didžiulę bendruomenę, o vykstant į didelį WordCamp renginį, pavyzdžiui, WordCamp US, kai nieko nepažįsti, gali būti labai baisu (ypač tokiai intravertei kaip aš), todėl nusprendėme pradėti nuo mažesnio WordCamp netoli mūsų. Taip mes atsidūrėme WordCamp Jackson, Mičiganas. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Važiuodami į vieną mieliausių mažų miestelių, kokius tik esame matę, labai nervinomės – o kas bus jei niekas nenorės su mumis kalbėtis?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Šios baimės greitai išnyko, kai įėjome į kambarį su maždaug 30 draugiškų veidų. Netgi miesto meras dalyvavo! Per pertrauką visi susėdome ant sofų, o naujieji draugai padėjo mums sukurti mūsų pirmojo reklaminių dovanų daikto dizainą: marškinėlius su piratu, klausiančiu &#8220;Arrrr you compliant?&#8221; (Ar esate atitinkantys?). Vis dar šypsausi, kai juos apsivelku. Nespėjome apsidairyti, o jau po naudingų pranešimų visi susėdome į automobilius ir vykome į pabėgimo kambarį. Draugystės, užmezgtos šio renginio metu, tęsiasi jau daugelį metų. Tiesą sakant, vienas iš mūsų draugų iš to pirmojo WordCamp padėjo mums pastatyti vištų tvartą.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_e8e690-2e wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Užeikit!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kiek vėliau mano vyras išvyko į Londoną ir susipažino su draugu per ne-WordPress renginį, ir jie tikrai susidraugavo (rimtai, jie kalbasi kas dvi savaites jau penkerius metus). Po kelių mėnesių atėjo metas mūsų pirmajam WordCamp US, ir mūsų draugas nuskrido iš JK į Čikagą, kad apsistotų pas mus, o mūsų planas buvo keliauti automobiliu nuo namų iki WordCamp. Tačiau nutiko taip, kad jo kitas draugas, kuris taip pat vyko į WordCamp (mes jo dar nebuvome sutikę), praleido savo skrydį. Mūsų draugas paskambino mums, paaiškino situaciją ir paklausė, ar jo draugas gali pakeisti skrydį į Čikagą, apsistoti pas mus ir prisijungti prie mūsų kelionės. Mes pasakėme: &#8220;Užeikit!&#8221; Tas praleistas skrydis privedė prie geriausios kelionės gyvenime ir viso gyvenimo draugystės.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aš visada prisiminsiu, kaip jis lydėjo mane į parduotuvę nusipirkti arbatos šaltą vakarą, kaip visi kartu pozavome nuotraukai prie Saint Louis arkinio paminklo, kaip per daugelį metų leisdavome laiką įvairiuose viešbučiuose ir Airbnb, dalijomės jaunystės istorijomis, stebėjomės augančių šeimų džiaugsmu ir jauduliu bei palaikėme vieni kitų verslo sumanymus. Per daugelį metų matėmės daugybę kartų įvairių kelionių ir WordCamp renginių metu, ir aš mus laikau pagrindine grupe šiuose renginiuose – saugia vieta viso šurmulio apsuptyje.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_e1e042-43 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Geriau kartu</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kai pradedate įsitvirtinti tam tikroje pramonėje ar bendruomenėje, galite pagalvoti, kad kiti žmonės šioje srityje yra konkurentai. Nors tai tikrai nėra geriausia žmonijos savybė, manau, kad taip nutinka dažniau, nei norėtume pripažinti. Kai buvau naujokė WordPress bendruomenėje, buvo viena pripažinta privatumo teisininkė, kuri buvo šios bendruomenės dalis daug ilgiau nei aš. Važiuodama į WordCamp US,&nbsp; žinojau kad ji ketina skaityti pranešimą apie Kalifornijos vartotojų privatumo įstatymą (CCPA) ir kaip laikytis šio privatumo įstatymo. Būsiu atvira – man buvo labai neramu ją sutikti. O kas, jei ji manytų, kad esu konkurentė? O jei jai nepatikčiau? O jei šiame renginyje nepakaktų vietos dviem privatumo teisininkėms? Gal man geriau viso renginio metu slėptis, kad tik ji manęs nepastebėtų?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiesa ta, kad dažnai kuriame kraštutinius scenarijus savo galvose, bet realybė dažniausiai būna visai kitokia (ir mažiau bauginanti). Greitai susidraugavome, nes supratome, kad esame vienintelės dvi moterys renginyje, kurios iš viso žinojo kas yra CCPA. Vakaro pabaigoje jau spraudėmės kartu į Uber važiuodamos į barą. Per tuos metus palaikėme viena kitos projektus, dalijomės ilgais pokalbiais vakarais, kartu išgyvenome sunkumus ir džiaugėmės pasiekimais. Dėl jos geranoriškumo ir svetingumo nepasukome konkurencijos keliu, o galėjome džiaugtis nuostabia simbioze ir tikra draugyste.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_545e9b-43 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Šeima visam gyvenimui</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leisti laiką su draugais „WordCamp“ renginiuose yra smagu, bet dar smagiau, kai draugystė tampa tokia stipri, kad draugai atskrenda pas jus tiesiog pabūti kartu. Na, šiuo atveju, mes spėjome pabūti tik vieną dieną, kol mano draugė labai susirgo. Ne „turiu gripą“ lygio susirgo, o taip, kad teko praleisti daugiau nei savaitę reanimacijoje ir kelis mėnesius ligoninėje.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tuo sunkiu metu susipažinome su jos šeima, kuri kurį laiką gyveno pas mus, nes gyvename labai arti ligoninės. Nors šis laikotarpis tikrai buvo alinantis visiems, jis taip pat suteikė naują perspektyvą, kaip draugai išgyvena sunkius laikus kartu. Nesvarbu, ar tai buvo kelionės į ligoninę, sėdėjimas kartu, verksmas kartu, naminiai patiekalai ar kiekvienos, net ir mažiausios pergalės šventimas – draugystė, bendruomenė ir žinojimas, kad esame vieni kitiems, padėjo mums išgyventi šį sunkų laikotarpį. Diena, kai ji išėjo iš ligoninės, buvo tikras stebuklas. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Dabar mes tikrai ne tik WordCamp draugės – mes šeima visam gyvenimui.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7820_9faddf-98 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Mažos smulkmenos</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Iki šiol mano gyvenime buvo daugybė bendruomenių – nuo mokyklos, šokių grupių, teisininkų asociacijų iki mano vietinės kaimynystės – kiekviena bendruomenė turėjo ką nors ypatingo.

This book is designed for beginners who want to learn how to create websites using WordPress 6.7 and its newest theme, Twenty-Twenty-Five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book starts by explaining the basics of WordPress, including how its block themes, block editor, and site editor work. Once readers understand these concepts, Kuno dives deeper into the Twenty-Twenty-Five theme. He provides a detailed overview of the theme’s files, layout structures, style options for blocks and fonts, and how templates and patterns connect to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuno also includes step-by-step guides for building two types of websites: a blog site and a coffee shop site. He uses clear explanations and helpful graphics to make everything easy to follow, even for beginners. While most of the instructions focus on using WordPress’s site editor, Kuno also touches on the underlying code for certain features, such as supporting post formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the book strikes a good balance between practical tutorials and technical insights. It’s an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn website design with WordPress in an approachable way.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.de/Creating-Website-Twenty-Twenty-Five-English-ebook/dp/B0DC53C7KK\"><img width=\"652\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-18.47.29.png?resize=652%2C392&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-38128\" /></a><em>Screenshot of Patterns and how they fit into the template structure of Twenty-Twenty-Five.

This bit talks about some of the meta-work that myself and the Bridge team at Automattic do.</em><br /><br />At Automattic, the most important product I work on is the company itself. I&#8217;ve started referring to it as the &#8220;Automattic Operating System.&#8221; Not in the technical sense like Linux, but the meta layer the company runs on. The company isn&#8217;t WordPress.com or Beeper or Pocket Casts or any one thing. I&#8217;m responsible for the culture of the people who build those things, building the things that build those things. It&#8217;s our hiring, our HR processes, our expenses, the onboarding docs; it&#8217;s all of the details that make up the employee experience — all the stuff that shapes every employee&#8217;s day-to-day experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take expense reports. If you&#8217;ve got to spend two hours taking pictures of receipts and something like that, that&#8217;s a waste of time. You&#8217;re not helping a customer there. We switched to a system where everyone just gets a credit card. It does all the reporting and accounting stuff automatically. You just swipe the card and it just automatically files an expense report. Sometimes there&#8217;s an exception and you have to work with the accounting rules, but it just works and automates the whole process most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another commonly overlooked detail is the offer letter. We think so much about the design of our websites and our products. We have designers work on that and we put a lot of care and thought into it. But I realized we didn&#8217;t have the same attention to detail on our offer letter. When you think about it, getting an offer letter from a company and deciding to take it is a major life decision, something you only do a handful of times in your life.  This is one of the things that determines your life path. Our offer letter was just made by attorneys and HR. No designer had looked at it right. We hadn&#8217;t really thought about it from a product experience point of view. And so it was just this, generic document with bad typography and not great design. But it&#8217;s important, so one of the things we did was redesign it. Now it has a nice letterhead, great typography, and it&#8217;s designed for the end user.<br /><br />I realized that the salary and stuff was buried in paragraph two. It was just a small thing in the document! Well, what&#8217;s key when you&#8217;re deciding whether to take a job? Start date, salary, you know, that sort of thing, so we put the important parts at the very top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s the legal language. All the legal stuff, which is different in every country. We have people in 90 countries, so there&#8217;s all the legal stuff that goes in there. And then it has this nudge inspired by the behavioral economics book, Predictably Irrational.<br /><br />There&#8217;s the story about how, if you have an ethics statement above where you sign the test or something, people cheat less. So I thought, well, what&#8217;s our equivalent of that? <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/\">We have the Automattic Creed</a>. It&#8217;s an important part of our culture. So we put the creed in, it says</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I will never stop learning. I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me. I know there’s no such thing as a status quo. I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers. I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything. I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day. Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not legally binding, but it&#8217;s written in the first person, you read it and you kind of identify with it and then you sign below that. We want people who work at the company who identify with our core values and our core values really are in the creed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These sorts of things are key to our culture.

I’ve personally included a professional headshot, custom banner image, some interesting images, and verified links to all my social profiles. These sections are completely customizable, and what you include depends entirely on your goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this especially <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2025/02/17/how-to-be-better-at-networking/\">useful for networking</a> is the QR code functionality. When <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/16/how-to-network-at-a-conference/\">meeting someone at a conference or event</a>, I can quickly pull up my Gravatar profile QR code from my phone’s digital wallet. With one quick scan, my new contact instantly has access to all my professional information.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1368\" height=\"1112\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png\" alt=\"Adding a Gravatar profile QR code to Apple Wallet and Google Wallet\" class=\"wp-image-3088\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-1 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<p>Anyone who scans my QR code can immediately connect with me through multiple channels – they can view my contact details, send me money, or browse through my featured photos for a more personal touch. No more fumbling with paper cards or manually typing contact info into phones.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>As a technical professional, my Gravatar profile is quite literally the foundation of my online presence. When I contribute to <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, post on <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a>, or communicate through <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, my Gravatar profile appears automatically, helping me build a more <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2025/01/10/personal-branding-social-media/\">recognizable personal brand</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"374\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ronnie-github-profile-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Ronnie Burt profile in GitHub\" class=\"wp-image-3090\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The best part? I only need to update my information in one place. If I change roles or add new contact methods, updating my Gravatar profile instantly refreshes my presence across all integrated platforms – saving time and ensuring consistency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to create your own universal digital business card? <a href=\"http://gravatar.com\">Sign up at Gravatar.com</a> using just your email address. It takes minutes to set up but provides lasting professional benefits everywhere you go online.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://gravatar.com/connect/?gravatar_from=blog\"><img width=\"3243\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/free_profile_cta.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2616\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Industry-Specific Showcases: Real Estate to Tech Professionals</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Real estate agents face unique networking challenges – they need to connect instantly with potential buyers and showcase properties efficiently. Digital business cards can help in this process by offering scannable QR codes that provide immediate connections with house hunters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/liznitzbozeman\">Liz Nitz&#8217;s</a> digital business card as an example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/liz-nitz-gravatar-profile.png?w=660\" alt=\"Liz Nitz Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-3091\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As a Bozeman-based real estate agent, her Gravatar profile functions as a powerful lead generation tool. When potential clients scan her QR code, they gain instant access to her contact information plus direct links to her real estate website, where current property listings are just a tap away. This approach eliminates friction in the buying process – no typing long URLs or searching for contact details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits go beyond real estate into technical fields where showing your expertise is extremely important. Tech professionals use digital business cards to highlight their portfolios, technical skills, and ongoing projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw\">Simon Willison</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://datasette.io/\">Datasette</a>, demonstrates this approach effectively through his <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> profile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"504\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/simon-willison-github-profile.png?w=660\" alt=\"Simon Willison GitHub profile\" class=\"wp-image-3093\" />\n\n\n\n<p>His presence includes links to his technical blog and personal projects, creating a comprehensive snapshot of his expertise. Visitors can easily contact him while exploring his work samples – all from a single profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this especially powerful for tech professionals is GitHub&#8217;s integration with Gravatar. When developers update their Gravatar profile picture, those changes automatically appear on GitHub and ensure a consistent, professional presence without requiring multiple updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many industries, digital business cards eliminate the limitations of paper while adding dynamic elements like direct portfolio access, property listings, and instant contact options – turning a simple introduction into a potential business opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Creative examples for freelancers and artists</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For creative professionals, first impressions matter tremendously. Digital business cards give artists and freelancers a powerful advantage – the ability to showcase their actual work during initial meetings rather than just talking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/talkingbullgames\">Jonathan H. Kantor&#8217;s</a> digital business card perfectly demonstrates this advantage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"544\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/jonathan-h-kantor-gravatar-profile.png?w=660\" alt=\"Jonathan H. Kantor Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-3094\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As an illustrator at <a href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/designers/talkingbull-games\">Talking Bull Games</a>, his Gravatar profile displays samples of his artwork directly on the card itself. New contacts can immediately see his illustration style and quality before clicking through to his full portfolio website. This visual introduction creates an instant connection that paper cards simply cannot match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/smcutts\">Shannon Cutts</a> uses her digital business card to establish her credibility as a freelance writer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/shannon-cutts-gravatar-profile.png?w=660\" alt=\"Shannon Cutts Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-3095\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Her profile links directly to her writing samples and service pages, allowing potential clients to quickly assess her style and expertise. This immediate access to her work helps her stand out in competitive pitching situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Jonathan and Shannon have enhanced their cards with integrated QR codes connected to payment systems. This smart addition means that when someone appreciates their work, they can commission or purchase it on the spot by sending payment directly to the artist&#8217;s designated eWallet. No invoicing delays or payment friction – just a seamless transaction from introduction to sale, all through a digital business card.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Corporate digital cards that mean business</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate professionals require business cards that convey expertise, professionalism, and comprehensive information. <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/thomasmccorry\">Thomas McCorry&#8217;s</a> digital business card exemplifies this approach perfectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/thomas-mccorry-gravatar-profile.png?w=660\" alt=\"Thomas McCorry Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-3096\" />\n\n\n\n<p>His Gravatar profile is like a mini-CV, with a detailed bio section outlining his professional history and accomplishments. The card includes direct links to his personal website, portfolio of work, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> profile – all organized in a clean, accessible format alongside professional photographs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This structured approach gives potential clients and contacts an immediate sense of Thomas&#8217;s experience and capabilities at a glance. Rather than trying to cram limited information onto a paper card, his digital version provides depth without overwhelming the viewer. Someone meeting Thomas can quickly understand his background and then access more detailed supporting materials about specific projects or expertise areas with a single tap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://it.gravatar.com/charlesleisure0\">Charles Leisure</a> takes corporate networking a step further by connecting a QR code to his digital business card.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"493\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/charles-leisure-gravatar-qr-code.gif?w=660\" alt=\"Charles Leisure Gravatar profile with QR code\" class=\"wp-image-3097\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This practical addition allows him to instantly <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/11/08/creating-a-digital-business-card/\">share his complete professional profile</a> during meetings or conferences by simply opening the QR code stored in his Apple or Google Wallet. Contacts can scan the code with their smartphone and immediately have all his information saved – eliminating the traditional business card exchange and ensuring his information never gets lost in a pocket or briefcase.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Create Your Perfect Digital Business Card with Gravatar</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a professional digital business card doesn&#8217;t require design skills or technical expertise.
