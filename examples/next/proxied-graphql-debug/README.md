# WordPress GraphQL Proxy Debugger

## Overview
A debugging utility for proxied GraphQL APIs within WordPress environments, offering enhanced query inspection, request/response logging, and real-time query complexity estimation.

## Features

* **GraphQL Proxy Debugging** - Intercepts and forwards GraphQL requests through a custom proxy.
* **Debug Print Output** - Logs proxied GraphQL queries and their responses for easier debugging.
* **Query Complexity Estimation** - Calculates the complexity of each GraphQL query using a customizable estimation algorithm.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18+ recommended)
* WordPress with WPGraphQL plugin installed
* [wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env/)
* Docker running (`docker ps`)

## Setup

### Install Dependencies

Run:
```
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file if your proxy requires environment-specific configs (optional).

### Start the Environment

To start WordPress and run your proxy/debugger setup:
```
npm run example:build
```

## How It Works

This debugging tool:

* Intercepts GraphQL POST requests sent to the WordPress GraphQL endpoint.
* Logs the incoming query, variables, and response payload.
* Estimates the complexity of the query based on field nesting and predefined multipliers.
* Provides output via console or log files.

## Complexity Estimation

The complexity estimator:

* Traverses the GraphQL AST to measure query depth and individual field cost.
* Applies configurable multipliers for specific fields or types.
* Can be integrated into request handlers to reject or warn on overly expensive queries.

## Running the Example with wp-env

### Clone and Install

```
git clone https://github.com/wpengine/hwptoolkit.git
cd hwptoolkit
npm install
```

### Build and Start Application

```
cd examples/next/graphql-proxy-debug
npm run example:build
```

This will:

- Start [wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env/)
- Import the database from `wp-env/db/database.sql`
- Install Next.js dependencies for `example-app`
- Run the Next.js dev server

| Command                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `example:build`        | Prepares the environment, starts WordPress, imports the database, and starts the application. |
| `example:dev`          | Runs the Next.js development server.                                       |
| `example:dev:install`  | Installs required Next.js packages.                                         |
| `example:start`        | Starts WordPress and the Next.js dev server.                                |
| `example:stop`         | Stops the WordPress environment.                                            |
| `example:prune`        | Rebuilds and restarts the environment by destroying and recreating it.      |
| `wp:start`             | Starts the WordPress environment.                                           |
| `wp:stop`              | Stops the WordPress environment.                                            |
| `wp:destroy`           | Removes the WordPress environment.                                          |
| `wp:db:query`          | Executes a database query in WordPress.                                     |
| `wp:db:export`         | Exports the WordPress database to `wp-env/db/database.sql`.                 |
| `wp:db:import`         | Imports the WordPress database from `wp-env/db/database.sql`.               |

>**Note:** You can run `npm run wp-env` and use other [wp-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env) commands as needed.

## Database Access (Optional)

If you need direct database access, add the following to your `wp-env.json`:
```
"phpmyadminPort": 11111
```
Check if the port is free:
```
lsof -i :11111
```
