# Overview

An example headless WordPress application using Next.js App Router and the fetch API to fetch data from WordPress using WPGraphQL It showcases different data fetching strategies, state management techniques, and modern web development patterns in a real-world application context. This also contains a full example using wp-env and sample data.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (if you plan on running the example see details below)

# Running the example with wp-env

## Prerequisites

**Note** Please make sure you have all prerequisites installed as mentioned above and Docker running (`docker ps`)

## Setup Repository and Packages

- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/wpengine/hwptoolkit.git`
- Install packages `cd hwptoolkit && npm install
- Setup a .env file under `examples/next/client-app-router-fetch-data/example-app` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=http://localhost:8888`
e.g.

```bash
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=http://localhost:8888" > examples/next/client-app-router-fetch-data/example-app/.env
```

## Build and start the application

- `cd examples/next/client-app-router-fetch-data`
- Then run `npm run example:build` will build and start your application. 
- This does the following:
    - Starts up [wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env/)
    - Imports the database from [wp-env/db/database.sql](wp-env/db/database.sql)
    - Install Next.js dependencies for `example-app`
    - Runs the Next.js dev script

Congratulations, WordPress should now be fully set up.

### Database access

If you need database access add the following to your wp-env `"phpmyadminPort": 11111,` (where port 11111 is not allocated).

You can check if a port is free by running `lsof -i :11111`
