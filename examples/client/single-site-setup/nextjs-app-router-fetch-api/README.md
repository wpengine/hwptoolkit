# Overview

This is an example project showing how to setup a WordPress headless site with [Next.js app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) using [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).


# How to run the example

We use [wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) for running local WordPress setups

@TODO - Add link to example README.md


To setup the WordPress instance you need to:

```bash
npm ci
cd examples/client/single-site-setup/nextjs-app-router-fetch-api/
pnpm example:build
```

You can then view the frontend of your application at `http://localhost:8888/`
The WordPress backend can be viewed at `http://localhost:8888/wp-admin/` and username and password is `admin` and `password`.
