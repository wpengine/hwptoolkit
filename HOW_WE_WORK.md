# HOW_WE_WORK

We believe in transparent, collaborative development. These guidelines document how we work together and with our community.

## Workflow

### Issues & Discussions

- Use **Issues** for bugs and features, **Discussions** for RFCs and support
- Only Issues appear on our [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/wpengine/projects/13)
- Cross-reference PRs, issues, and discussions to maintain context

### Pull Requests

- Focus each PR on a single concern
- Use Draft PRs for work-in-progress changes
- Clearly flag breaking changes and update relevant documentation
- Notify the team when PRs are ready for review
- Request reviews from specific maintainers based on expertise
- Leave a comment in the PR to say ready for another review after follow up commits from a review

### Releases

- Schedule releases Monday-Wednesday only
- Distribute to WPE Updater and WordPress.org when applicable

## Effective Communication

- Work in public by default (except for security/private infrastructure)
- Tag issues accurately with "good first issue" and "help wanted" when appropriate
- Write commit messages explaining *why* changes were made, not just what
- Document decisions in GitHub discussions, issues, and PRs
- Actively share your work with the community

## Code Review Standards

- Pull requests require 1 approving reviews before merging 
- Reviewers: specify what aspects were reviewed
- Submitters: indicate which parts need focused attention
- Provide constructive feedback with supporting evidence
- Request changes considerately, noting their importance
- Leverage automation for routine checks ([PR Lint Example](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/blob/develop/.github/workflows/lint-pr.yml))

  >[!NOTE]
  >A developer should use their own discretion on how many reviews they would like before merging.

## Community Commitments

- Acknowledge new contributions within 2 business days
- Provide thorough answers to questions
- Update documentation when knowledge gaps emerge
- Recognize all types of contributions

These guidelines evolve as our team and community grow. Suggestions for improvements are welcome.
