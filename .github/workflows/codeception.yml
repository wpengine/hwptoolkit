# This does the following:
# 1. Detects modified plugins that have codeception.dist.yml configuration setup
# 2. Runs  Codeception tests on those plugins using the custom action
# 3. Creates a matrix job for each plugin that has a quality configuration
# Bonus: This means you can have plugin specific badges e.g.
