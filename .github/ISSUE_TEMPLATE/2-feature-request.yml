          ### Example: Image Optimization Component for WordPress Headless Toolkit
        
          #### User Story
          As a frontend developer building media-rich headless WordPress sites,
          I want a dedicated image optimization component with responsive handling,
          so that I can deliver faster page loads without implementing complex optimization logic myself.
        
          #### Acceptance Criteria
          - [ ] Create a drop-in Image component that works with WordPress media URLs
          - [ ] Implement automatic responsive sizing based on viewport
          - [ ] Support modern image formats (WebP) with appropriate fallbacks
          - [ ] Integrate lazy loading with zero configuration required
          - [ ] Include simple documentation with before/after performance examples
        
          #### Notes
          The current workflow requires manually handling image optimization, which leads to inconsistent implementations across projects. A standardized component would improve site performance metrics and developer experience while ensuring best practices are followed across all projects using the toolkit.
