# Installing HWP Toolkit Plugins with Composer

You can install any HWP Toolkit plugin using Composer, which is the recommended way for modern WordPress development workflows.

You can also install them manually from our [Releases](https://github.com/wpengine/hwptoolkit/releases) page.

## Requirements

- Composer 1.x or 2.x
- WordPress 6.0+
- PHP 7.4+

### Available Plugins

- [wpengine/hwp-previews](https://github.com/wpengine/hwptoolkit/tree/main/plugins/hwp-previews#readme)
- [wpengine/wpgraphql-webhooks](https://github.com/wpengine/hwptoolkit/tree/main/plugins/wpgraphql-webhooks#readme)
- [wpengine/wpgraphql-debug-extensions](https://github.com/wpengine/hwptoolkit/tree/main/plugins/wpgraphql-debug-extensions#readme)
- [wpengine/wpgraphql-logging](https://github.com/wpengine/hwptoolkit/tree/main/plugins/wpgraphql-logging#readme)

## Quick Start: Example `composer.json`

Copy and use this example as your `composer.json` for a typical WordPress project using HWP Toolkit plugins:

```json
{
  "name": "wpengine/headless-wordpress-toolkit-composer-test",
  "description": "Headless WordPress Toolkit Composer Test",
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "composer",
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wpengine/hwptoolkit/main/plugins/composer-packages.json"
    }
  ],
  "require": {
    "wpengine/hwp-previews": "*",
    "wpengine/wpgraphql-webhooks": "*",
    "wpengine/wpgraphql-debug-extensions": "*",
    "wpengine/wpgraphql-logging": "*"
  },
  "config": {
    "allow-plugins": {
      "composer/installers": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation Steps

1. **Copy the above JSON into your project's `composer.json` file.**

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Activate the plugin(s) in WordPress**

   Go to the WordPress admin and activate the plugin(s) as usual.

## Updating

To update to the latest version:

```bash
composer update wpengine/hwp-previews wpengine/wpgraphql-webhooks wpengine/wpgraphql-debug-extensions wpengine/wpgraphql-logging
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an error about missing `composer/installers`, run `composer require composer/installers`.
- If the plugin does not appear in your plugins list, check your `installer-paths` and that you are in the correct WordPress directory.
- Ensure the `repositories` section is present and correct in your `composer.json`.
