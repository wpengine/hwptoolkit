The Headless WordPress Toolkit is a modern, framework-agnostic toolkit for building headless WordPress applications. It provides a collection of plugins, packages, and examples to help developers make WordPress a better headless CMS.

Our goal is to provide developers with the tools they need to build fast, scalable, and secure headless applications with WordPress, without being tied to a specific frontend framework.

## Plugins

The toolkit includes several WordPress plugins to enhance the headless experience.

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [wpgraphql-logging](../plugins/wpgraphql-logging/) | Logging for WPGraphQL requests with granular lifecycle events and Monolog integration. |
| [hwp-previews](../plugins/hwp-previews/) | Headless Previews solution for WordPress: fully configurable preview URLs via the settings page which is framework agnostic. |

## Examples

This project contains a wide variety of examples demonstrating how to use the Headless WordPress Toolkit with different frameworks like Next.js, Astro, SvelteKit, and Nuxt.

Most examples include a `wp-env` setup, allowing you to fully configure a headless application with a single command.
