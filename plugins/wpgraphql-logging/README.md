## Overview


WPGraphQL Logging is a plugin that integrates directly with the WPGraphQL Query Lifecycle, capturing detailed information about each GraphQL request.

### Key Features
*   **Granular Control**: Choose which events in the request lifecycle to log, giving you precise control over the data you capture.
*   **Developer-Friendly Extensibility**: Built with developers in mind, it features a pub/sub system that allows you to hook into the logging pipeline, transform event data, and trigger custom actions. 
*   **Flexible Log Handling**: Leverages the powerful Monolog logging library, enabling developers to add custom processors and handlers to route logs to various destinations like Slack, files, or external services.

>[!IMPORTANT]
