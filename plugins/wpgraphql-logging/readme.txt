A WPGraphQL logging plugin that provides visibility into the GraphQL request lifecycle, giving developers the observability needed to quickly identify and resolve bottlenecks in their headless WordPress application.

== Description ==

**WPGraphQL Logging** is a comprehensive logging solution for WPGraphQL that tracks and records GraphQL query execution, providing developers with detailed insights into query performance, errors, and request lifecycle events.

**Note:** This plugin is currently in BETA. While it is functional and ready for testing, some features may be subject to change based on community feedback.

= Key Features =

**GraphQL Request Lifecycle Logging**
* Pre Request (`do_graphql_request`): Captures query text, variables, and operation name
* Before Execution (`graphql_before_execute`): Records request parameter snapshot
* After Execution (`graphql_execute`): Logs response data, schema context, and request details
* Before Response (`graphql_return_response`): Inspects response for errors and automatically escalates log level when errors are present

**Advanced Admin Interface**
* View and filter all logged GraphQL requests in the WordPress admin
* Search and sort by date, query name, log level, or custom criteria
* Export logs to CSV for offline analysis
* Configurable data retention policies with automatic cleanup

**Flexible Event System**
* Built-in pub/sub architecture for subscribing to logging events
* Priority-based event handling
* Transform and mutate log payloads before storage
* WordPress action/filter bridges: `wpgraphql_logging_event_{event}` and `wpgraphql_logging_filter_{event}`

**Powerful Storage & Context**
* Built on Monolog for reliable, industry-standard logging
* Default database handler stores logs in WordPress table (`{$wpdb->prefix}wpgraphql_logging`)
* Extensible processor system includes:
  * Memory usage tracking
  * Web request context
  * Process ID tracking
  * GraphQL-specific request metadata

**Customization Options**
* Add custom log processors via filters
* Implement custom storage handlers
* Define custom logging rules and conditions
* Extend the admin interface with custom fields and tabs

= Use Cases =

* **Performance Monitoring**: Identify slow queries and execution bottlenecks
* **Error Tracking**: Monitor and debug GraphQL errors in production
* **Development & Testing**: Track query behavior during development
* **Compliance & Auditing**: Maintain records of API access and usage
* **Analytics**: Analyze query patterns and usage trends

= Requirements =

* WordPress 6.5 or higher
* PHP 8.1.2 or higher
* WPGraphQL 2.3.0 or higher

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin production-ready? =

This plugin is currently in BETA. It is functional and ready for testing in staging environments. We recommend thorough testing before deploying to production.

= Does this plugin affect GraphQL query performance? =

The plugin is designed to have minimal performance impact. Logging operations are performed asynchronously where possible, and you can configure data retention policies to manage database size.

= Can I export my logs? =

Yes! The admin interface includes CSV export functionality for all filtered log entries.

= Can I customize what gets logged? =

Yes, the plugin provides extensive hooks and filters to customize logging behavior, add custom processors, and implement custom storage solutions.

= How do I delete old logs? =

The plugin includes configurable data retention settings. You can set automatic cleanup rules to delete logs older than a specified number of days.
