# WPGraphQL Webhooks

## Overview

A WordPress plugin that extends [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) to support webhook subscriptions and dispatching for headless WordPress environments. This allows external applications to listen and respond to WordPress content changes through GraphQL-driven webhook events.

**⚠️ Work in Progress:** This plugin is under active development and not yet production-ready.
